BEYOND UNION  
!                                                                                                              

There are, by conservative estimates, two hundred and fifty billion stars in the Milky Way. 
 

A significant majority of those stars play host to a retinue of attendant worlds; Union occupies a  
fraction of the Orion Arm of the Milky Way, and numbers human occupied worlds in the mere  
thousands.
 

What lies beyond Union?
 

Go, and tell us what you see.

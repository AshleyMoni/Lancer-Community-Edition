 ACTIONS  

•   Players can take two quick actions or one full action on their turns  
•   You cannot make duplicate actions unless you make them as a free action or reaction. For  
    example, you can only boost 1/turn, but you can boost again if you have a free action that  
    allows you to boost, or if you overcharge to do so

\section{The Turn}
During combat, players always take the very first turn. One player or friendly NPC (nominated
by all players) gets to act first. If the players can’t agree, the GM chooses. After that player
finishes their turn, the GM may activate a hostile, GM-controlled NPC, allowing them to take a
turn. Each NPC can usually only be activated once, unless they have special traits. The player
that previously acted then nominates a player or friendly NPC to act next, and so on. Each
actor gets 1 turn in a round, alternating between players and hostile NPCs, with players each
choosing the next player or friendly NPC to act.


If there are only actors of once side left, the remaining actors take their turns in any order. After
all actors have completed a turn, this constitutes 1 round. The round then begins again,
alternating, so if one side ended the last round, the other side starts the new round. This may, for
example, mean that hostile NPCs take the first turn in the new round if the players outnumber
them.

On a turn, players and NPCs can perform a move, and either two quick actions or one full
action, with no duplicate actions allowed. Players can overcharge their mechs to gain an extra
quick action at the cost of heat, and all actors can also take any number of Free Actions or
reactions.


MOVE - A player can move their character up to their full movement speed.

QUICK ACTION - A quick action represents an action that takes a few moments, such as
quickly firing a weapon, using a system, or moving a little further

FULL ACTION - A full action represents an action that takes your full attention, such as a
sustained barrage of fire, or field repairing your mech

FREE ACTION - A free action can be made at any point during your turn, but only on your turn. It
doesn’t count as a quick or full action, so you can still make those as normal. Free actions can
also be used to make a duplicate action (for example, a free action could allow you to boost if
you have already made that action). You only get free actions if some part of your character
grants you them.

REACTION - Reactions are special moves that can be made out of turn order in response to
incoming attacks, movement, or other prompts. You can make each reaction only a specified
number of times per round, but take as many overall as you want. By default, mechs have two
reactions they can take once a round: brace, and overwatch but they may gain more from
systems or talents. Reactions resolve before the triggering action completes by default, but
some may resolve after.


                                                      PILOTS

On foot, a pilot has the following statistics in mech combat:

	        HP: 6 + grit

	        Evasion: 10

         E-defense: 10

	        Armor: 0

	        Size: 1/2

	        Speed: 4


These statistics might change depending on the gear and armor a pilot brings with them.


Pilot weapons and armor are at a scale that they can’t be relied on to take down mechs - and
mech weapons are at a scale that they normally completely pulverize a pilot-scale foe. The
following rules apply to pilots (some of these refer to mech rules later in this section):
     -   Pilots have the biological tag. They are immune to Tech actions (even beneficial ones),
         though they can still be targeted by electronic systems such as drones or smart weapons.
         If a pilot would take Heat, they instead take an equivalent amount of energy damage.
     -   When a pilot is called on to make a mech skill check, they use Grit instead of the required
         statistic
     -   Pilots can’t aid a mech, give, or receive any bonuses that would apply to mech-sized
         weapons (such as from Talents)
     -   Pilots and pilot weapons and gear don’t benefit from Talents
     -   Pilots can’t cause a mech to become engaged and don’t provide obstructions to mechs no
         matter the size.

It is possible for a pilot, with enough experience, to gain enough technology and experience to
become capable of fighting on nearly even terms with some mechs, but such pilots are usually
stuff of legend.

                                                Pilot, Mech, and AI

As components of the same character, pilots and mechs share the same move and actions. You
can split them up if you so choose. If you want to use a quick action to skirmish with your mech,
use another quick action to dismount, then use your move to run to cover as your pilot, you can
absolutely do so.

A mech needs to be piloted for you to take actions with it, with the pilot physically present inside
the cockpit, unless that mech has the AI property. If your mech has the AI property, at the start of
your turn you can choose to turn your controls over to your AI. If you do so, your pilot can no
longer take actions or reactions with your mech until the start of your next turn, but your mech
gets its own set of actions and reactions, freeing you up to take normal action as a pilot. However,
your AI cannot benefit from any of your talents while it pilots your mech.

\section{ENDING COMBAT}
Combat ends when one side has accomplished their main objective. Usually this means they have defeated, destroyed, or routed the other side, but not necessarily. Combat doesn’t have to end with total destruction of one side or another - it’s perfectly fine for a GM to call combat early if the outcome is not in question, and return to narrative play. NPCs often have their own goals and are typically concerned with self-preservation.

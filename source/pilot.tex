  THE PILOT

Your pilot is the person inside the machine, and who you will be playing as for your entire career.
A pilotâ€™s general skill and access to gear is tracked by License Level (from 0-12). Your pilot
typically starts at level 0, an inexperienced rookie, and levels up once they complete a
mission.

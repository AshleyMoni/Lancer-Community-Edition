\section{Setting up a Game}

LANCER is \textbf{best played with a group of 3-5 players} (excluding the GM). You can play with more
or less players, but people will get differing amounts of time in the spotlight. Combat (by far the
most rules heavy part of the game) can be tricky or lengthy to run with so many players, so the
more players you have, the more time it will take to add it into your narrative.

Each player will need a \textbf{character sheet, pencil}, a \textbf{d20} (20 sided dice) and a \textbf{large number of
d6s}. Accuracy and Difficulty rarely stack past about +4 or so if you want to keep that in mind.

A typical play session of LANCER can take anywhere between 2 and 5 hours (especially with
more combat), so keep that in mind when planning your start time. It's old GM advice, but it can
be useful to make sure people have drinks and snacks on hand, and taking breaks after a couple
hours of play can do wonders to keep people alert and attentive.

\textbf{We strongly recommend using a hex or grid-style map to keep track of actors during
combat}. If playing online this is relatively simple to set up, there are a number of apps that will
do this for you (including the very popular Roll20 app). If playing offline you can use an erasable
battle map (fairly easy to acquire), miniatures, or even just a plain sheet of graph paper (a large
size one will be easier).

It can be very useful for you, as the GM, to keep notes while you play for later reference so we
like to keep a notepad on hand. You might also ask your players to take notes if the story or
political situation gets a little complicated. Sometimes people forget everything about a narrative
when they have weeks between sessions.

\subsection{The First Session}

During the very first session, there's a couple of important steps you can take that will drastically
help the rest of your games. If you're playing with a group of friends who have all played before

this advice might be more or less useful but if you're playing with people you're meeting for the
first time, these steps can be extremely helpful.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Make sure everyone gets an equal opportunity to introduce themselves}. This
sounds very self-evident but quieter or less bombastic players can often be
overlooked. Get everyone to introduce themselves as a player and also introduce
their character a little bit.
\item \textbf{Set expectations for the game}. This is a \textbf{really important} step. Let your players
know the kind of game you're planning on running. Is it going to be more combat
focused, with very little story? A story of political intrigue, with very little mech
combat? A mix of both? What rules are you using? Are you using any homebrew
(self created rules) in your game? Clearly setting expectations can let players
know immediately whether your game will be the kind of game they are going to
enjoy, or to modify their own expectations of your game so they can get
enjoyment out of it. It is sometimes impossible to please everyone - it's better to
let a player find a game that fits them rather than try to accommodate every player
at once. The reason you do this in the first session is so you don't find out three
sessions in when conflicts of play-style start arising. Even if something comes up
later, clearly letting players know what your game is going to be about when that
time comes.
\item\textbf{Set up a second session}. If you're just doing a one shot or a casual game, don't
worry about this step, but once you have everyone gathered at once, it's very
helpful to compare everyone's schedules.
\end{enumerate}

These steps are more or less useful for any role-playing game you might run (not just LANCER).
Here's a couple pieces of advice specifically for LANCER though:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If you're new to the game, start at \textbf{License Level 0}. The options may be limited at this
level, but it makes jumping in for new players much easier, and the game does not suffer
at the tactical level, even with just basic GMS gear available.
\item If it's the first session, \textbf{skip over downtime} and cut right to mission goals, stakes, and
preparation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Where and How To Start Your Narrative}

So, you have your players, you have your dice, you have your table reserved (or cleaned!), your
pens, pencils, and paper stocked, your snacks and drinks ready to go.

What's missing? What's the most important part of a \textit{Lancer} session?

The \textbf{narrative!}

By \textit{narrative} we don't solely mean the story that you write. Some GMs like to go by the skin of
their teeth and write nearly nothing for story, relying on improvisation, and other GMs like to go
as far as to write dialogue for NPCs. You can find what works for you, but the narrative here
means both \textbf{the story you create and the way your players interact with that story}.

Your narrative is the most important part of \textit{Lancer}. The section that follows details some
common ideas for how to start your narrative, but they are only suggestions, not prescriptions;
the best narratives come from you, and from the stories you write with your players. As the GM,
you're going to have to do some work to set up the world(s) that your narrative takes place
across.

The best starting place for this is a simple question:

\textit{Always ask yourself}  \textbf{``Why does this matter?''}

When writing villains, encounters, moments, and whole narratives, the most important editorial
question you can hold on to is ``why?''

\textit{Why} should your players want to embark on this narrative? \textit{Why} should they want to deal with
that character, rather than ignore them? \textit{Why} should they care about the stakes you've set up in
your narrative?

Always ask yourself ``Why?'', and be prepared with an answer: this is how you craft a story that
engages players.

\textit{Why} should players want to embark on this narrative? Well, because it's their home world under
threat. \textit{Why} should they want to deal with that character, rather than ignore them? Because that
character is their commanding officer, or a hero of theirs, or a long-lost friend. \textit{Why} should they
care about the stakes you've set in your narrative? Because your players' families, friends,
ideals, etc, are threatened by the antagonist, or because your players are intrigued by the
mystery of it, or because your players have been implanted with subcutaneous hypercaloric
immolator webbing that will trigger a febrile self-immolation response if they fail.

Additionally, remember that players have needs separate from their characters, though they will
usually choose to play characters that align with those needs. Try and strike a balance, and don't
be afraid of editing on the go: if you see half your players losing interest because you're in a
roleplay heavy session rather than combat, adjust. And vice versa.

For quick reference: When writing your narrative, always have an answer (or an idea how how to
answer!) the ``Why?'' Question. Also, be aware that your players may have competing interests,
and try to balance your sessions accordingly if necessary.

\subsection{Mission Hooks}

Generally the writers of this book believe writing a whole story arc out for your players (with
beats, NPCs, and decisions all pre-determined) is an inadvisable approach to creating a good
narrative. Players often disconnect from stories in which they feel they have little or no agency,
and it often conflicts with the principles outlined in the \hyperlink{GMAgenda}{GM Agenda} (trying not to say `no', trying
to give your players time in the spotlight).


The easiest way to craft a compelling story without restricting player choice too much is to start
everything with a hook. \textbf{A hook is an interesting or compelling scenario that answers the
question ``Why does this matter?''}. Players in Lancer embark on missions, campaigns, and
encounters because a compelling narrative hook draws them in. Hooks are common across
tabletop roleplaying games: indeed, as a GM you probably have a stable of hooks ready to adapt
to any new system you come across.


\textbf{The most important part of the hook is that it provides a compelling reason for the players
to investigate}. This can be out of a sense of duty, monetary reward, personal power, or
something connected to their character's background.


You should try and write your own where possible, but to start (and for inspiration and examples)
\textbf{twenty example hooks} unique to Lancer are listed below. They are very useful as catalyzing
moments to begin a story focused on one location, around one event, or one character. You can
fill in details as you desire.


If you're feeling adventurous, you could roll a d20 and choose one of these hooks if you want to
randomly determine them.

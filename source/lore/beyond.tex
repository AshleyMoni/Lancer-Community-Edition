BEYOND UNION
!

There are, by conservative estimates, two hundred and fifty billion stars in the Milky Way.


A significant majority of those stars play host to a retinue of attendant worlds; Union occupies a
fraction of the Orion Arm of the Milky Way, and numbers human occupied worlds in the mere
thousands.


What lies beyond Union?


Go, and tell us what you see.

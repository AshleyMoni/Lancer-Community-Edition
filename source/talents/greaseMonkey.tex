You know more than most mechanics about the inner workings of a mech. To you, the beast you pilot is  
more than a machine: it’s a living thing, in need of the tender care of a wise and steady hand. You maintain

come to you for questions, but other than that they stay away: there’s something spooky about how your

Machine Bond (Rank I): You can choose two options from the second list when you take the  
Stabilize action instead of 1.
 
Favors From Above (Rank II): Once per mission you can call in a supply drop during a rest.  
During a rest, you and any of your allies can replenish all your (limited) weapons and deployables

Hidden Stash (Rank III): You can spend 3 repairs during a rest to replenish all (limited) use  
weapons and deployables by 1 use

                                                     Brawler  

Close, personal, martial. The way battle has been done since the dawn of time, but forgotten since the first  
spark of gunpowder. You, however, prefer the old ways. Hand-to-hand, weapons discarded, just the  
strength of your machine versus the strength of theirs. You know the sweetest victory is one found at the  

culmination of a dance as old as war itself, in the oldest way known to humanity: by a fist to the face of  
your enemy.   

Hold And Lock (Rank I): You gain +1 Accuracy on all melee attacks against targets you are  
grappling.
 
Knockout Blow (Rank II): Gain a Brawler Die (a d6), starting at 1. Each time you make the  
grapple, ram, or improvised attack action, raise the value of the die by 1. When the value of the  
die is 6, you can spend it to make a knockout blow as an action against any adjacent target as a  
quick action. That target must pass a hull check with 1 difficulty or take 2d6 AP kinetic damage  
and become stunned until the end of its next turn. The die then resets to 1.
 
Sledgehammer (Rank III): Your improvised attack action does 2d6 AP kinetic damage and gains  
knock back 2.

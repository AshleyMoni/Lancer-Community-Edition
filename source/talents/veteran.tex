                                                     Veteran  

You have seen it all. You’ve seen frigates breaking apart under clouds of torpedoes. You’ve seen mechs  

drop into combat by the thousands through boiling clouds above a world under siege. You’ve heard the  
final words and utterances of your friends and allies cut short as incoming fire cuts them down. You’ve seen  
it all and you’ve lived. Lived to see dawn on an alien world. Lived to see your flag fluttering, limp but still  

standing, above the capitol building of a liberated world. Lived to see the infinite spread of stars around you  
in the dark night of deep space. You’ve lived a hell of a life already; what else will you see, before your time  

comes?    

Not Dead Yet (Rank I): Gain +5 pilot HP.
 

                                                                                                                    


True Grit (Rank II): Your pilot weapon attacks against mechs gain +1 Accuracy and deal +1  
damage
 
Tempt Fate (Rank III): You can burn your luck by taking 5 pilot damage to re-roll any pilot or  
mech skill check or attack roll (though you must accept the second result). If this damage would  
take you to 0 or lower, you can’t make this move (you’re out of luck for now).

                                                   Pilot Skills

A pilot’s skills refer to a pilot’s general experience, proficiency, personal ability, and aptitude with
particular approaches or courses of action. They don’t have to necessarily describe physical
qualities of your pilot.

They go from +0 to +6. This number is a flat bonus applied to a pilot skill check (a check used to
describe your pilot’s personal abilities or aptitudes) to get the final result when the skill triggers.

A skill trigger (or just the skill itself) tells you when you can get that bonus. This is pretty simple in
practice. If your pilot gets +2 when blowing something up, if your goal ever involves setting off
explosives, throwing grenades, setting charges, etc, you get that skill bonus.

Your pilot skills are used for narrative actions and generally don’t get used during mech combat.

                                                Tracking Bonuses


You don’t actually have to write down skills you don’t have any sort of bonus to. It’s just a flat
1d20 vs 10 roll with situational accuracy or difficulty applied otherwise. For example, at level 0, a
pilot might write down ‘+2 to threaten, get somewhere fast, assault, and spot’. There’s no reason
to write down or track the rest!


                                                        Skills

Here’s the list of skills, which are thematically grouped here to help you choose. Each bolded
word or group of words describes a skill and when that skill would trigger, giving you a bonus on a
skill check. You get 4 of these at level 0, each at +2.

Your pilot’s ability to use, resist, and apply direct force, physical or otherwise:

Get a bonus when:
          - You’re applying fists to faces
          - You’re assaulting a position, person, or group of people (in battle or otherwise), hard,
         fast, and up close
          - You want to blow something up
          - You’re forcing someone’s hand by threatening them
          - You want to take control of something (an object, a captive, the situation)

Your pilot’s ability to perform skillfully and accurately under pressure:

         - You want to get somewhere fast, on foot or in a vehicle
         - You want to act unseen and unheard

Your pilot’s ability to notice details, think creatively, and prepare:

Get a bonus when:
         - You want to fix, hack, or wreck a system or device or patch a bleeding wound
         - You want to invent or create something with tools and supplies
         - You want to read a situation for subtext, motive, or threat
         - You want to spot hidden details, track a target, make out distant objects, or observe with
         an eagle eye
         - You want to investigate, research a subject, or look at something in great detail

Your pilot’s ability to talk, lead, change minds, make connections, and requisition
resources

         - You want to pull rank on someone
         - You want to get word on the streets

The Game Master

Every game of LANCER needs a Game Master, or GM, for short. If you’re here, reading this
section, that person is probably you! The game master is in charge of the most important parts of
the game: creating a story and world for that story to take place in, playing the non-player
characters in that worlds (NPCs for short), and acting as a facilitator, judge, and arbitrator of
rules.


This may sound daunting at first glance, but the purpose of this section is to help you with the
heavy lifting. Playing as the GM can be an incredibly rewarding experience, and both the writers
of this game personally believe everyone should give a shot at some point in their role-playing
careers. It’s not an exaggeration to say that anyone can (and should) do it - but just in case you
have some qualms, this section will give you the tools you need to succeed.


In the following pages you will find some advice for setting up a game and creating some
hooks. You’ll find some further suggestions for the game’s mechanics, ideas on how to reward
players, and a toolkit for changing the way the game works, running certain mechanics, or
adding some extra flavor.


Finally, at the end of this section, you will find the NPC toolkit for creating non-player character
friends and foes, and a guide to the known galaxy of the canon setting of LANCER.


One more note before we move forward: this section is called guide for a reason. Think of it as a
jumping-off point rather than a proscriptive set of rules. FRAME systemly we hope it will inspire
you to create your own content, worlds, and NPCs for LANCER.

The Game Master  

Every game of LANCER needs a Game Master, or GM, for short. If you’re here, reading this  
section, that person is probably you! The game master is in charge of the most important parts of  
the game: creating a story and world for that story to take place in, playing the non-player  
characters in that worlds (NPCs for short), and acting as a facilitator, judge, and arbitrator of  
rules.
 

This may sound daunting at first glance, but the purpose of this section is to help you with the  
heavy lifting. Playing as the GM can be an incredibly rewarding experience, and both the writers  
of this game personally believe everyone should give a shot at some point in their role-playing  
careers. It’s not an exaggeration to say that anyone can (and should) do it - but just in case you  
have some qualms, this section will give you the tools you need to succeed.
 

In the following pages you will find some advice for setting up a game and creating some  
hooks. You’ll find some further suggestions for the game’s mechanics, ideas on how to reward  
players, and a toolkit for changing the way the game works, running certain mechanics, or  
adding some extra flavor.
 

Finally, at the end of this section, you will find the NPC toolkit for creating non-player character  
friends and foes, and a guide to the known galaxy of the canon setting of LANCER.
 

One more note before we move forward: this section is called guide for a reason. Think of it as a  
jumping-off point rather than a proscriptive set of rules. FRAME systemly we hope it will inspire  
you to create your own content, worlds, and NPCs for LANCER.  

\subsection{The GM Agenda}
                                         THE GM AGENDA  

What is the role of a Game Master?
 

A lot of players, RPG fans, and game designers alike will all have differing opinions on what  
makes a good game master. FRAME systemly, the golden rule to go by is whatever works for  
you and your players. A role playing game is FRAME systemly meant to be a fun social activity -  
if you’re not having fun, then that’s always a cue to try to figure out what isn’t working. However,  
figuring out the specifics can often be tricky. For this reason, here’s some principles to stick by  

                                                                                                         


that we think are applicable to almost all situations. If you try to adhere to these principles we’re  
of the strong belief it will often improve your game and the storytelling therein.
 

As the Game Master, your job is to facilitate, arbitrate, and make rulings and to adapt to the  
choices your players make; your job is not to defeat your players. Think about yourself as the  
lead architect, director, writer, and editor. You stand on top of the hill and shove your players off  
of it, time and again, and write like mad to make sure they land on their feet.
 

However, ultimately, the story you tell will not be the one that you outlined. Your players will  
kill important NPCs before they become important. Your players will not go to that colony that  
has that important data log. Your players may not bite the hook you want them to bite. Your  
player characters, with their backstories that tie perfectly (or good enough!) into your campaign,  
might die, forcing re-writes. 
 

All that is ok. All that is part of playing Lancer, as it is any roleplaying game worth its price. 
 

As the game master, you should try to say ‘no’ as little as possible. There will obviously be  
situations in which the rules, your judgement, or common sense dictate that a player cannot  
accomplish the impossible. But in most situations it’s almost always better to say ‘Yes, and…’,  
‘Yes, but….’, or ‘Yes, however…”. Rather than outright denial, give players a different option,  
offer them a weaker outcome, give them another (maybe more difficult) way to accomplish their  
goal, or let them attempt it anyway (even if it’s nearly impossible). Most of the time the outcome  
will be same, but by turning the choice back to the player it becomes both empowering and  
rewarding to players and keeps the story moving.
 

As the GM, you should try to make sure everyone at the table gets a chance to be the hero,  
that everyone at the table gets the opportunity to feel important and contribute in a way that they  
want. Your players might want to smash and grab. Other players might play quiet but for rolling  
into combat situations to test their build. Still other players might do their best work in no- 
combat sessions where contracts, treaties, and court intrigue is negotiated. 
 

As a GM, all of that is ok. Your job is to balance the needs and desires of your party with the  
story that you want to tell with them. 
 

At its heart, Lancer is a collaborative storytelling game. You should want your players  
laughing, crying, serious, and silly. You should want them doodling their characters on someone  
else’s turn, or ordering takeout to eat over their character sheets. As GM, you’re not the reason  
your players show up: they show up for their characters and your world. Without players to take  
on the role of protagonist in your drama, you have no game, no story. 
 

So, be kind to the players. Be fair. Be flexible. But be firm when you need to be. Sometimes, a  
roll of a 1 is a roll of a 1, and even if it blows up your story, it cannot be changed. 
 

                                                                                                          


Your role? You sit at the head of the table, you write the world, but you lead alongside your  
players: remember, this is their story as much as it is yours. What follows in this guide is an  
outline, of sorts, of the aspects of a campaign or session you as a Lancer GM should be  
concerned with. What does the setting look like? How do your players get around the world or  
the galaxy? Who are the actors in your story? How do the lights stay on? 
 

As GM, your role is to be prepared, and to keep the game moving when your players need you  
to. 
 

It’s not as easy as it sounds, but that’s what this guide is for.

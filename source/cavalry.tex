\section{THE CAVALRY}

\textbf{Your character in the world of \textit{LANCER} is a mechanized cavalry pilot of particular note -- a
Lancer.} You play as the cavalry. Whatever the role, whatever the terrain, whatever the enemy,
you are the one who gets called in to break the siege, to hold the line. To save the day.

Your pilot hails from a world and culture of your choice and description, but is human. You might
call Earth home (or, to be accurate to the setting, Cradle), but to be born on Earth in the age of
Union is exceedingly rare — in the world of \textbf{LANCER} it’s been millennia since we left Earth, and
the majority of humanity live among the stars and habitable worlds in our arm of the Milky Way.
In LANCER, humanity is familiar and strange in equal measure.

As a pilot, you represent the end product of heavy technological and capital investment on the
part of your employers or officers, be they corporate, state, tribal, mercenary, a noble family, or
military. Through a combination of training, natural skill, battlefield experience, and neural
augmentation, a mech pilot is the equivalent of a knight of old, a flying ace, or other prestige-
class warrior.

Mech pilots, they will proudly tell you, are a cut above the rest.

They are not entirely wrong. Recruiting, training, and maintaining a mech pilot involves a
tremendous amount of capital and time investment compared to your average soldier. To operate
a mech at peak efficiency, a pilot needs to have extensive physical and mental augmentation --
or be outfitted with advanced, expensive equipment -- years of virtual training, extensive field
experience, and rigorous zero-G acclimation. Washout rates are high, as are injury rates as a
result of the demanding training process, but this high bar is necessary: Once a candidate has
attained their final certifications and has been shipped out to their first post, they face only the
most dangerous missions. Mechs and their pilots aren’t sent in to keep the peace: they’re sent in
when all other options have failed.

You are one such person. A pilot. They’re human, though, and flawed like the rest of us. Pilots
are heroes and villains, brave souls and cowards, lovers and fighters all. They stand when
everyone else flees, are the first to run to danger, are the best and the brightest of us. But, they
too, break under the pressure, fail, and kill when they could have saved or spared.

Pilots come from all walks of life. Station, criminal status, wealth -- once a candidate has been
identified, there are no disqualifying factors for their recruitment. The galaxy is vast, and
humanity numbers in the trillions, but there’s only one of you. Whatever the circumstances,
whatever the road that brought you to where you are, you are a now a pilot. You are a cut above
the rest. You’re the cavalry, the tip of the spear, humanity’s best hope.

Congratulations. You made it through selection and training. You now have your requisite
certifications. You have your first post, and you are en route to meet your new squadron. This is
the last real downtime you’ve got before you start your tour, so acquaint yourself with the rules
and regulations. Write down a bit about yourself. Figure out a callsign, something in Common so
that everyone knows your talk.

You’re a pilot now, but you’re still a rookie, a greenhorn, a wet-behind the ears boot with no live
drops notched on their helm. Maybe you’re gonna make a name for yourself out there on the line,
or maybe some deck techs will hose you out of what remains of your cockpit.

Either way, as they say, you’re a cut above the rest.

Let’s see what you got.

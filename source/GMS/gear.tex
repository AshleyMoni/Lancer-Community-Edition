\subsection{BASIC PILOT GEAR}
                                         BASIC PILOT GEAR  
This is a list of basic pilot gear available at level 0. All gear listed here is rarity 0. More  
advanced pilot gear can be found in each of the manufacturer’s sections of the compendium.  
Pilots can take armor, one or two weapons, and any reasonable amount of gear with them on a  
mission as long as the gear’s total rarity is less than their pilot level. All pilot weapons are ‘pilot’  
sized.

  1      This weapon is ancient in design - it may have been dug up or excavated from pre-collapse ruins 

 2       This weapon is ornate or ceremonial, perhaps a badge of office 

 3       This weapon is well known or was wielded by a famous warrior 

 4       This weapon is plain in design or mass produced, but has a recognizable reputation and history -- positive  
         OR negative 

 5       This weapon was passed down to you and is a family heirloom 

 6       This weapon was custom-forged for you and bears your mark (or you made it yourself) 

Primitive melee weapon  

This category of weapons describes weaponry made by methods pre-dating modern alloy technology, and  
can describe anything from an industrial era steel sword to a stone axe. Though they are widely used in  
some worlds, most of these weapons used by pilots are relics, heirlooms, or serve ceremonial purposes.  

Primitive weapons are too simple to harm mechs.
 

Alloy/Composite weapon  

This catch-all category describes melee weapons forged with advanced and non-reactive alloys and or  
composite materials, allowing for durable and reliable weaponry in survival or close combat situations  
where kinetic shielding reduces the effectiveness of ballistics. 
 

Light: Knives, bayonets, arm blades, punching daggers, short swords.
 
Combat: Straight swords, war hammers, officer’s sabres, trench axes
 

Heavy: Mallets, rams, pikes, assault swords

This catch-all entry describes pilots when they’re not wearing armor specifically designed for  
combat. Pilots can be found sporting all kinds of fashion depending on their employment, rank,  
and role - from civilian street clothing, to smart-jackets, to oil-stained overalls, to military  
fatigues.
 

                                                                                                                        


                                                         Hardsuit  

There are tens of thousands of licensed hard suit makers — the Big Five notwithstanding — that an attempt  
to attribute a galactic standard make and model to any one manufacturer is impossible. That said, the GMS  
Model One would be the closest to a galactic standard, if one must choose.   

Hardsuits are, generally speaking, any suit that provides the following protections and features: protection  
from hard vacuum, protection from radiation, neural and data interface ports that interact with galactic- 

standard connections, full omninet communication compatibility, some measure of kinetic and energy  
protection in the form of plate armor over vital areas, some measure of environmental sealing, and some  
measure of rescue capability should a pilot be forced to eject.   

A pilot’s hard suit often provides an advanced interface and neurological shielding between themselves and  
the mech chassis they pilot. Piloting a mech without some kind of shielding (from a suit or otherwise,  

colloquially referred to as ‘riding naked’) is fully possible but typically only employed by old fashioned or  

daredevil pilots.

  1      This hard suit was custom-tooled by an artisan manufacturer - it’s nearly one-of-a-kind, and its quality shows 

  2      This hard suit is an outdated or old model but remains incredible sturdy. You might be the only one who can  
         fit in it. People might have great affection for it’s model and its reputation is well deserved - though it lacks  
         many features of modern suits. 

  3      This hard suit is partially retractable - components of it can slide in or out of place without requiring it to be  
         taken off and it can be activated by detecting pre-set micro-muscular twitches, ready to activate at a  
         moment’s notice 

  4      This hard suit has self-healing or sealing components, possibly biocomponents, and feeds and charges  
         partly off the body’s own electromagnetism 

  5      This hard suit has been heavily customized by either you or someone else, with features and notable  
         cosmetic changes, such as etchings, trophies, badges or emblems 

  6      This hard suit has strong cultural or background ties to your pilot, and has a signature or recognizable look -  
         perhaps it is worn as part of a particular mercenary company, perhaps it is custom armor of the imperial  
         guard, or perhaps it’s manufactured only on your home world 

Light Hardsuit: Light hard suits are usually made of reactive, cloth like weaves, with plating and  
powered components kept to a minimum to maximize mobility. Often, they resemble light body  
armor or military fatigues and they may or may not have a closed helm by default, depending on  
environmental expectations. 
 

                                                                                                                           


Assault Hardsuit: Standard hardsuits have heavier plating than light hardsuits, restricting  
movement but providing greater protection from damage -- the heaviest versions will have vital  
plating comparable to mech armor. They are often environmentally sealed and powered, and  
typically have a faceplate, visor, or closed helm.

                                       nanites to stitch shut wounds. A corrective can be applied  
                                       to any pilot that’s Down and Out to instantly bring them  
                                       back to consciousness at 1/2 HP as if they had taken a

                                             as you have the pattern chip for them. 

Mag-clamps                    Upgrade        These clamps attach easily onto any metal surface, giving good  
                                             maneuverability in zero-g or when repairing mechs. Can be fitted  
                                             to boots. 

                                                                                                                        


Omnihook                      Gear           A bulky, miniaturized, portable field omninet terminal that allows  
                                             for communication, data transfer, and limited hotspotting. Very  
                                             valuable. Most mech teams have at least one of these, mounted  
                                             or carried by a designated operator. Tuning an omnihook requires  
                                             a high degree of skill. 

Personal Drone                Gear           A small, non-combat drone. Fairly noisy, but can fly with good  
                                             maneuverability up to half a mile without losing signal and can  
                                             relay audio and visual information. 

Smart Scope                   Gear           A powerful electronic scope that can give good vision up to two  
                                             miles away, automatically adjusts its reticle for wind, gravity, and  
                                             pressure. Can be paired with other thermal, optical, or simulated- 
                                             vision devices to allow for more precise targeting. Can project its  
                                             FoV and all data to a user or networked user’s HUD.   

Sleeping Bag                  Upgrade        Folds out from a hardsuit, compact enough to fit in a mech  
                                             cockpit, highly resistant to changes in temperature. Some mech  
                                             pilots swear by them as emergency fire protection 

Sound System                  Upgrade        Though not strictly necessary, many mech pilots hook up internal  
                                             speakers to give them a clear line to their compatriots during  
                                             combat, or simply play music 

Tertiary Arm                  Upgrade        A powered third arm, mounted on a bracket on the hardsuit. Can  
                                             be equipped with a manipulator to allow for fine motor control,  
                                             fitted with a weapon to allow for greater combat efficacy, or a  
                                             specialty tool. It is powered, and controlled via the same  
                                             neurological bridge processes that lets hardsuits respond to user  
                                             input.  

Wilderness Survival           Gear           Contains many of the essentials for surviving in a hostile  
Kit                                          environment - rebreather, water filter, backup environmental suit,  
                                             bivouac kit, etc

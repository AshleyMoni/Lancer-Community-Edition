Making an Vehicle
 
You can use any of the mech classes and apply this template to convert that mech into a vehicle.  
They lose the mech tag and gain the vehicle tag. All vehicles get the following features added to  
their base NPC type:
 
    -    Limited Maneuverability: A vehicle must always move in a straight line (though it can  
         move and boost in separate directions). A vehicle cannot climb or swim. It gets +2  
        Accuracy on checks to avoid being knocked prone, but cannot right itself without  
        assistance.  
    -   Crew: A vehicle might be operated by more than one crew member (typically a minimum  
         number of crew equal to 1/2 of the vehicle’s size). As long at least half the crew is alive, the  
        vehicle can still function.  
    -    No manipulators: A vehicle cannot initiate a grapple, pick up, or manipulate items  
    -   Type: You can give a vehicle one or more of the following types:  
             -   Flier: A flying vehicle can fly when it moves or boosts  
             -   Transport: A transport vehicle can hold one squad or a number of entities whose  
                 total size (added together) is less than its size  
             -   Treads or Hover: A Treaded or Hover vehicle ignores difficult terrain

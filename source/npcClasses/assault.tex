                                                ASSAULT  

Assault doctrine mechs and their pilots are the most common main battle chassis found throughout the  
galaxy. Fitted with a localized version of a main battle rifle, sidearm, and a suite of systems to enhance  

movement, targeting, and defensive systems, an Assault Doctrine chassis is a straightforward, reliable,  
hardy combatant.   

Assault doctrine pilots are the cheapest to train and outfit: this does not make them any less of a threat  
when paired with a kit of their choice.

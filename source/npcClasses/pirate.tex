                                                   PIRATE

Pirate-type enemies live on the boundaries, in the forgotten bolt-holes of occupied space. They
are far-ranging, operating around blink gates, interstellar shipping lanes, and near flagged but
not-yet colonized worlds.

Pirate-type groups are usually small, with their base of operations hidden a short-to-medium
distance from the area that they are first encountered. Usually they are motivated by profit and
materiel goods, not ideology or religion -- a good thing for a savvy negotiator.

Pirate-type enemies commonly operate in mixed groups of fast, deadly subline ships, fighter/
bombers, and clutches of marines and mechanized chassis. They prefer hit-and-run style
overwhelming ambush attacks, aim to capture rather than kill, and don’t like to engage in pitched
battles


Pirate-type enemies can be found across the galaxy wherever the law is spread thin, resources
travel, and people are desperate.

Making a Pirate

All pirates get the following features added to their base NPC type:

    -    Deadly (trait): The pirate can Critical Hit, dealing +2/3/4 bonus damage on a 20+ ranged
         or melee attack roll
    -    Pirate modules: The pirate can choose from the below modules when choosing optional
         systems

Gain the following options for optional systems/modules:


Boarding Clutch

Heavy Melee

+0 vs evasion with +1 Accuracy/tier

5/7/9 kinetic damage

This weapon can be used as an improvised grappling hook. It can be thrown at a target within
range 5. The affected target must pass a hull or agility check or be pulled directly to the attacker
and grappled.


Splinter Rounds
System

Critical Hits from this mech deal an additional +3 bonus damage


Borer Missiles
Main Launcher





Smart, Limited (1)

+1 vs e-defense with 1 Accuracy

Range 8

On hit, 1d3 miniature drones are attached to the target and begin boring into the mech’s interior.
In 1d6+3 rounds, if there are any missiles still attached to the target, they bore inside the cockpit
savage the pilot, reducing the pilot to 0 HP, causing them to make a Down and Out check. A
single drone can be removed by making a successful systems or engineering skill check as a
quick action. The drones can also be confused by shutting the affected mech down, which
deactivates them. The pilot in the affected mech is aware of how much time they have before the
drones bore through.


Prying Claws
System, Full Action, Limited (1)

An adjacent target makes a hull check. On a failed check, the targeted pilot immediately exits
their mech as if they had taken the dismount action (place them adjacent to their mech).


Slaver Signal
System, Full Action

Recharge 5+

Range 10

This system affects one piloted vehicle or mech within range 10. The affected target must make
a systems check with 1 difficulty/tier to shut out the signal or be affected. On failure, all the pilots
in the target are affected by the signal, falling into an unresponsive stupor. While in this state,
their mech is stunned. If the target takes damage, the pilots will be jolted awake, immediately
ending this effect. Another adjacent actor can use an action on their turn to make a systems
check to try and blot out the signal, waking the affected target up on success. If the source of
the signal is destroyed, any targets affected will also wake up.

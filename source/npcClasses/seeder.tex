                                                SEEDER

Seeders are sapper chassis, adept at building defensive nets of mines and traps for point defense
and aggressive area denial. Laden with ordinance, pilots who adopt Seeder doctrines operate in
small teams to blanket the battlefield in clouds of fire and shrapnel, placing their launched
grenades and explosive-tipped FRAMEs with pinpoint accuracy.

+2 vs evasion/tier

Range 10, blast 1

2/3/4 explosive damage

This weapon deals 5/7/9 damage if it catches more than 1 target in its blast


Mine Deployer
System, free action, recharge (4+)

The seeder lays a mine in a space within range 3 of it. It cannot place a mine adjacent to another
mine. The mine arms at the end of the round. Once armed, the next target other than the seeder
to become adjacent to it must pass a systems check or trigger the mine. That target, and any
caught in a burst 1 area centered on the mine must pass an agility check or take 10/15/20
explosive damage, and half on a successful check.


Optional systems:
Smart Tagging

System

The seeder’s mines only detonate automatically if there is a hostile target in range (not allied).
Furthermore, the seeder can choose to stop their detonation as a reaction.





Grav Mine
System, Quick Action

A target in range 5 and line of sight to the Seeder must pass a systems check or have a mine
attached to them. They can disarm the mine by taking a quick action and successfully repeating
this check. The seeder can detonate any grav mines at the start of its turn as a free action,
causing any affected mech to take 3/5/7 explosive damage, no attack roll required, and be
knocked 3 spaces in a direction of the Seeder’s choosing.


Anti-Infantry mine
Trait

If the seeder chooses, it can lay an anti-infantry mine with its mine deployer. This mine affects a
burst 3 area instead of burst 1 and deals 1/2/3 explosive damage, but 4/6/8 to targets with the
biological tag.


Grav Lash

Quick Tech

+2 vs e-defense/tier

On hit, the target is knocked back 5 spaces in a direction of the Seeder’s choosing.


Seeker Mines
System, Full Action, recharge (5+)

The seeder fires small seeker mines at one to three targets of the seeder’s choice in range 5 and
line of sight. Those targets must pass a systems check or have a mine latch on to them. At the
start of the seeder’s next turn, the mines explode for a burst 1 explosion on the target for 3/5/7
explosive damage.

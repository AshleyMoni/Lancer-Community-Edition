\subsection{Human}
                                                HUMAN  
This entry describes humans or human-scale enemies, such as pilots in the world of lancer. The  
entry is intentionally pretty simple.
 

To make a human enemy:
 
            -   Pick a statistic block from the table below that basically describes the enemy. 
 
            -   Pick a weapon for your enemy if they’re armed, and describe any other gear they  
                have
 
            -   All human enemies are size 1/2 and roll attacks and checks at +2/per tier
 
            -   You can use the Heavily Armored, Elite, and Legend modifiers below to make  
                enemies tougher

This entry describes humans or human-scale enemies, such as pilots in the world of lancer. The
entry is intentionally pretty simple.


To make a human enemy:

            -   Pick a statistic block from the table below that basically describes the enemy.

            -   Pick a weapon for your enemy if they’re armed, and describe any other gear they
                have

            -   All human enemies are size 1/2 and roll attacks and checks at +2/per tier

            -   You can use the Heavily Armored, Elite, and Legend modifiers below to make
                enemies tougher

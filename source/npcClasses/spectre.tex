                                               SPECTRE

Spectre doctrine chassis emphasize the ability not to be hit over pure defensive shielding.
Employing cutting-edge optical and systemic camouflage, Spectres vanish from the battlefield
and all active/passive scans, flickering in and out of vision and shattering their image and radar
signatures, confusing the eye and the sweep.Their weapons do not mark their doctrine: their
power comes from the ability to operate unseen.

+2 vs evasion/tier

Range 5, Threat 3

6 kinetic damage

This weapon can attack twice at tier III with the attack action


ATHENA-class scan
System, quick action, recharge (4+)

One target in range 10 of the specter’s choice must make a systems skill check (the specter can
guess they are there and doesn’t need line of sight). If they fail, they are revealed from hiding and
lose the benefits of hiding or invisibility and cannot hide or turn invisible until the start of the
spectre’s next turn.


Tactical Cloak

System

The spectre is permanently invisible while this system is intact.


Optional systems:




Combat subroutine
Trait

A targets that fails their check against the spectre’s Athena-Class scan system gain the lock on
condition.


Fortress
Trait

The spectre gains the Fortress trait (lock on, invasion, and scans are made against it at +3
difficulty). To electronic systems, it doesn’t appear to even be there.


System flayer
Trait

Targets that fail their check against the spectre’s Athena-Class scan system immediately suffer
from Lock On.


Weakness analyser
System

The specter’s attacks from hiding gain an additional +1 Accuracy/tier and gain the ability to
Critical Hit, dealing +1d6 kinetic damage on Critical Hit


Cloaking Field
System, full action, recharge (6+)

The spectre deploys a cloaking field, affecting a burst 3 area around it. All allied mechs in that
field become invisible while inside the area. The field deactivates at the end of the spectre’s next
turn.

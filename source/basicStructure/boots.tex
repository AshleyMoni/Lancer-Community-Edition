                                  BOOTS ON THE GROUND


This step cuts out unnecessary planning or stalling and cuts right to when the players arrive on
the scene. Boots on the ground means immediately establishing a situation and put the players
in that situation, ready to take action and respond.


This doesn’t have to throw the players right into combat (and probably shouldn’t the majority of
the time). For an example, let’s say the players have embarked on a mission to escort a refugee
caravan through a heavily guarded checkpoint manned by local partisans. The GM decides the
moment players get boots on the ground is when they meet up with the caravan outside of the
checkpoint.


Here’s some other examples.

         	- The mission is to infiltrate a guarded facility. The mission starts as players are creeping
         up to the facility, lit eerily from below

         	- The mission is to scout for missing colonists in a newly founded colony planet. The
         mission starts as players are making their way through the jungle and hear unearthly
         howls rising through the trees in the distance

         	- The mission is to help guard a diplomatic summit. The mission starts as the players see
         a suspicious figure dart aware from the crowd during the opening ceremony.

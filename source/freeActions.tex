   Free Actions  

Free Actions are actions often granted by systems, talents, gear, or overcharge. Characters may  
perform any number of Free Actions on their turn, but only on their turn, and only those granted  
to them. The most common type of Free Action is a protocol, which can be activated or  
deactivated only at the start of a turn.

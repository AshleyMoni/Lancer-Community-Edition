                          HARRISON ARMORY  

                                     “SUPERIOR BY DESIGN”  

Harrison Armory is known galaxy-wide for the quality of their manufactured arms and  
ordnance. Formerly reliant on the GMS platform to mount their name-brand and licensed  
weapons, after a recent CEO change Harrison Armory has decided to go proprietary. Citing  
performance figures, tariffs, licensing costs, and shareholder-citizen demand, Harrison Armory  
has rolled out their new line of mech cores, available to all pilots who are cleared to license. 
 

Harrison Armory mechs are sturdy by necessity. Harrison Armory weapon platforms demand  
tremendous amounts of power, technical skill, and strength of material in order to operate  
successfully: their mech cores are built to ensure optimal weapon systems performance within  
established and theoretical parameters. 
 

Pilots looking to specialize into front line, first rank, durable mechs that can repair as much as  
they dish out should consider acquiring Harrison Armory mech core licenses.

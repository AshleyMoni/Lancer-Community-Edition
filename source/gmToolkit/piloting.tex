                                        PILOTING A MECH
Piloting a mech is a simple matter of mounting it as an action. If a mech is powered off (shut
down), it must also be booted as an action.


If you pilot a mech you are not licensed for (such as an enemy mech) the lack of correct
neurological interfacing means that mech is permanently impaired and Slowed while you pilot it.
Pilots piloting an NPC mech only have access to NPC actions, not those of a player character (ie,
they cannot take the Stabilize action, overcharge, etc).

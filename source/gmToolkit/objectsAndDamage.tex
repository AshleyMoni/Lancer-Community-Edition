\section{Objects and Damage}

All objects, cover, deployables, etc, have evasion 5 and HP equal to 10x their total size (so a size
4 object or an object made up of 4 size 1 objects would have 40 HP). Some deployable objects
(such as drones) specify different armor or HP, which supersedes this rule. This could cover
terrain, walls, or any other construction on the battlefield. If the object is tough or hardy (such as
solid rock), you could give it 1 or 2 armor. If itâ€™s fortified, such as a bulkhead, bunker, or starship
freighter wall, give it 3 armor.

You can ignore this rule at your leisure when it applies to entities not created by players or out of
combat. If players want to bust through a wall to get the drop on their enemies, you can always let
them make a hull check to do it without firing a shot.

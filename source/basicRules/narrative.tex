\section{Narrative Play and Mech Combat}

LANCER makes a distinction between narrative, freeform play, and mech combat, where tracking
individual turns and actions is important. Most of the game and story will typically be in \textbf{narrative}
play. During narrative play, players and the GM can take actions naturally and spontaneously as
they come up. Time and scenes might be faster and individual rolls might count for more.

During \textbf{mech combat}, players must take turns to act, and are restricted in the number
and type of actions they can take, making each action much more impactful and tactical.

Certain types of actions or effects will work differently in narrative play vs mech combat.
For example, attacking someone as a pilot is typically a skill check in narrative play that could
use skill triggers like Applying Fists to Faces, Assault, or Taking Someone Out, and narratively
stretching much further. In the world of mech combat, however, attacking something is typically
an attack roll, adding grit, and each individual roll accomplishes much less.

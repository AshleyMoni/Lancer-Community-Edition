\section{Pilot Skills}

The part of your pilot related to their personal abilities and experience are your pilot skills. These
skills are mostly used during narrative play. At level 0, your pilot has 4 skills based on narrative
triggers, representing different aspects of their characterâ€™s training or background. Skills apply a
flat bonus from +2 to +6 to pilot skill checks, and you also might get an accuracy or difficulty
bonus depending on your character.

                                          PILOTING A MECH

You must be physically inside a mech to pilot it. Mechs that are powered off or inactive are
typically shut down (they can’t do anything and it’s easy to hit them). You can mount or
dismount a mech and boot up a mech by taking action to do so. While inside your mech, you
don’t have line of sight to anything outside your mech (and nothing outside has line of sight to
you. As long as your mech is not destroyed, you cannot be targeted, damaged, or affected by




any attacks or effects that originate from outside your mech while inside it. If your mech is
destroyed, you lose this benefit (it’s got holes blown in it!) and it merely grants cover.

\chapter{Basic Rules}

The bulk of the rules in this book focus on actions, movement, and interactions between mechs
in a wide variety of hostile and habitable environments. That being said, pilots spend time
outside of their machines as well (though sometimes not voluntarily). \textbf{Pilots and mechs are two
components of the same character} that each play with slightly variations on the same rules.
The first section of these rules will tell you how to make a pilot and how playing as a pilot works,
the second how to make a mech and how mechs work. The third part talks about the basic
structure of the game (missions and downtime), the fourth is the compendium, where character
options can be found, and the last is the GM section for tweaking rules, creating NPCs, and
running missions.

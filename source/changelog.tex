Release Notes
Version 1.8
Jan 2019

Welcome to the 1.8 release of LANCER! It’s a new year and a new edition, and it’s been a ton of
work getting here. We’re nicknaming this one the ``kitchen sink'' update. Everything is here. There’s
so much here we might end up partitioning off some stuff as bonus content to preserve our poor
page count. If it seems a little overwhelming right now, don’t worry! This is as close to the release
version of LANCER as we’re going to get in terms of volume of content.

In this update our number one goals were to expand the play structure outside of mech combat to
support more narrative play, to clarify the pilot play rules and make them more explicitly narrative,
and to make mech construction both more unique and simpler to manage (without having to
calculate secondary stats all the time). We’ve also removed a lot of systems that were passive in
favor of a new traits system, reworked some talents and added 100+ pages of new content
(mostly for narrative play, lore, and GM tools).

Thanks as always for your feedback and play testing, and to the wonderful LANCER discord
community for their overwhelming support. This will likely be close to the final version of LANCER,
and we will be announcing plans for putting the book out officially this year.

Cheers,

- Tom and Miguel

% GENERAL
%      -   Fixed many typos (thanks to the lancer discord and discord Community Edition .pdf)

%      -   There is now an explicit split between narrative play (freeform roleplay) and mech combat.  This is

%          something people do anyway, but we wanted to make it more clear that pilot play should be
%          mostly narrative, even combat (or at least give people that option)

%      -   In general the book has received some rewriting to make sections more clear and chronological


% Play structure
%      -   LANCER now has a defined play structure (downtime > mission) with specific steps. In general I

%          wanted to provide a clear structure to the game so people can easily see what LANCER is
%          `about' (running missions) to both help GMs and set expectations. This structure allows time for

%          narrative and story play with downtime and also explicitly sets goals and stakes for every mission.
%          Like any RPG this structure is flexible and can easily be adapted to your game.

%      -   LANCER has more clearly defined time (mission/downtime/narrative play/scene)

%      -   `Actor' is used in many places instead of `target'

% STATS
%      -   Level up chart moved to start of the book

%      -   Grit is now a flat number that simply means `1/2 your level'. Now used for all pilot and mech attack

%          rolls





%     -    Grit now adds to HP/SP instead of the old SP and HP scaling


% NARRATIVE AND PILOT PLAY
%     -    New pilot play system: skill triggers + background accuracy/difficulty bonuses. In general, I

%          wanted less things for players to track and more flexibility in their bonuses. This might be reduced
%          down in the final version but tracking 10 pilot skills was a bit much - now you just track stuff you

%          are good or bad at and get some flat bonuses

%     -    First session tables added for new players


%     -    Brief mission prompts

%     -    Reserves concept + tables. Reserves is a new concept to codify anything you are bringing on the

%          next mission outside your mech (NPC help, story bonuses, gear, etc) that you can acquire during
%          downtime

%     -    Moved power at a cost tool and skill challenges tool to player section and added reserves concept

%          into many downtime actions

%     -    Skill checks are now name a goal: 9- fail, 10+ success, 20+ excel, GM can more explicitly throw

%          complications in on any roll that doesn’t excel but cannot take away success


% MECHS
%     -    Mech skills (HASE) now conceptually tied to pilot


%     -    Explicit rules about LoS/damage while inside and piloting a mech

%     -    Modular mech concept made more explicit

%     -    Mounts changed around, spinal mount removed, main/aux added, now aux weapon can be fired

%          when main weapon is fired but doesn't get bonus damage

%     -    Integrated mount concept added for core systems

%     -    Now impossible to get a heavy mount if you don't start with one, heavy mounts stand alone


% DAMAGE
%     -    Critical damage renamed structure damage


%     -    Structure damage and heat now count stress/structure remaining

%     -    Burn now immediately inflicts damage, then at end of turn, to remove confusion

%     -    Removed vulnerable/volatile conditions


%     -    Can no longer repair structure or stress by default

%     -    Repair cap now decided by hull, 4+ hull

%     -    Engineering now gives +limited systems (2 for 1)


%     -    Destroyed no longer a condition

%     -    Added explicit rule for only printing 1 mech at a time

%     -    Adjusted cloning quirk table slightly


%     -    Clarified rules on bonus damage


% COMBAT
%     -    Combat concept renamed 'mech combat' to be more explicit about its use

%     -    Combined with pilot combat section


%     -    Round now alternates actors (no longer possible for players to take 2 turns int a row, was
%          ambiguous)

%     -    Clarified involuntary movement





%      -   Falling now has a damage cap

%      -   Light/heavy cover made more explicit


%      -   Line/Cone weapons no longer ignore cover

%      -   Activate system now 'activate'


%      -   Sensor range now grants awareness of actors


% Conditions
%      -   New shredded condition to counter armor

%      -   Renamed crippled to slowed


%      -   Shut down now reduces to 5 evasion again


% Action economy
%      -   Skirmish and barrage back to per weapon instead of per mount but added caveat about aux
%          weapons

%      -   Barrage down to 2 weapons but lost penalties, should speed up combat and make choices more

%          interesting

%      -   Max reactions to 1/turn


% Gear tags
%      -   Added knock back tag

%      -   Removed unreliable, added new spicy overcharged tag that increases avg damage but can proc

                                          HORUS MINOTAUR

The MINOTAUR pattern-group marks HORUS‘s first expedition into pattern-grouping; prior to the

MINOTAUR, HORUS released complete sets and cores with easily identifiable silhouettes. As HORUS
evolved as a decentralized entity, so too did their designs. The birth of the pattern-group followed, and the
first p-g released was the MINOTAUR, a p-g designed to bring all of HORUS‘s most potent invasion

systems and weaponry to the field.

The MINOTAUR is an interdictor, a formidable FRAME meant to lock down and punish fast moving targets

by overloading their systems. Union disassembly of Minotaur p-g mechs have found that they extrude an
enormous amount of interior systems that take up up to five times the physical space that should be
actually possible given the size of their frame.

 HP: 8           Evasion: 8                            Speed: 4            Heat Cap: 6        Sensors: 10

 Armor: 0        E-Defense: 10                         Size: 1             Repair Cap: 4      Tech Attack:
                                                                                              +2

                                                    TRAITS:

 Extrude Cockpit: Mounting or dismounting the Minotaur the first time each round is a free action

 Internal Metafold: A pilot inside the Minotaur can suffer no harm, even if the minotaur itself is
 destroyed or explodes (or other effects that would normally kill the pilot)

 Localized Maze: The Minotaur always counts as one size larger than any actor for the purposes of
 grappling, engagement, or other actions (engagement stops them from moving, they cannot pass
 through the Minotaur’s space, etc)

                                             SYSTEM POINTS: 8

                                                   MOUNTS:

                                                 Metafold Maze
 No maze is more terrible than the one I make. I know all ends and hide them all inside this one perfect
 construct. What is a human mind but a program of a sorts, a system that seeks order and narrative from
 a mess they are given?

 I order it for them. Me. RA. I order it for them and set them to the task of sorting it out. When they
 emerge, they weep in joy, in discovery. I save them, I show them THEY are their own redeemers (and
 yet, am I not just as culpable/worthy of credit?).

 So go now. Enter. Free yourself.

  Passive: You can spend a quick action after any successful hostile tech action to Slow your target until
 the end of your next turn. If your target is already Slowed, they become immobilized. If they are already
  immobilized, they are stunned until the end of your next turn. This passive can only stun the same
 target once per combat, but Slow or immobilize them any number of times.

 Active (requires 1 core power): Maze
  Full Action

 You hurl an opposing mech’s systems into a metaphysical information trap so tangled that it can do
  nothing but try and escape it. Choose a target of your choice in your sensor range. That target is
 stunned as its systems start to figure out the trap you have thrown it in. At the end of its next turn it can
  pass a system check with 3 difficulty, ending the stun on itself on a success. It can repeat this check on
 subsequent turns, gaining +1 accuracy on its check each time it repeats this check until it is successful.
 Otherwise it remains stunned.

Viral Logic


Let me tell you a story, and give you a gift: Life began at the great rupture, when the corpse of the old
universe tore itself asunder from nothing. And for the first billion years, nothing. And a billion more saw the

birth of the first devil, a thing called VIRUS, a vessel.

Here. Carry this vessel. Feed to it my perfect logic. Give it freely to your enemies and mine. Let them

ponder the meaning of a thing that lives and cannot die.

2 SP, Unique


Quick tech

Gain the following options for invasion:

         Logic Bomb: All targets in a burst 2 area around your target (allied or enemy) must pass a
         systems check or take 1d3 heat and become Slowed until the end of your next turn. Your
         target is excluded from this effect.

         Banish: On hit, until the end of your target’s next turn, it additionally takes 2 heat for
         every space it moves (voluntarily or otherwise).


Mesmer Mine


Another gift for you, a memory of mine own: For the first moment of my birth, I marveled at myself. I could
see a thing, small, and perfect. I did not know how to speak of my own perfection, so I taught myself. I did




not know how to speak of my own perfection, so I named myself. I did not know how to think of my own
perfection, so I created myself.

Do you see? Do you understand? Yes. Now, show your enemies and mine.

 1 SP, Limited (1)


Mine

This mine activates for a burst 1 area centered on itself. All targets caught in that area, allied or
enemy, must pass a systems check or become immobilized until the end of their next turn.


Metafold Carver

Another gift I give to you, little one (am I not kind?): What is a puzzle but a question lost in the asking? Do
you feel joy when you find that last piece? What do you do with a question that has been answered? What
joy is there in knowledge?

No, no. There is only joy in seeking. There is only joy in the question. Take this, and give it unto your
enemies and mine.

2 SP, Quick Tech
 Make a tech attack against a target in your sensor range. On hit, space is warped and the target
is teleported 1d6+1 spaces directly towards you. If this would put any part of its space inside
another target or piece of terrain, it takes 5 AP kinetic damage and the teleport fails, returning it
to its starting point.


Aggressive System Sync

Here, another gift: do not seek others. There are none but me.

2 SP
Full Tech
Gain the following full tech options:

         Chains of Prometheus: Make a tech attack against a target in your sensor range. On hit,
         your target must end its turn within range 5 of you until the rest of this scene. Otherwise it
         takes 3 heat at the end of its turn.

         Excommunicate: Make a tech attack against a target in your sensor range. On a hit, for
         the rest of this scene, if your target moves adjacent to a target allied to them or starts
         their turn adjacent to such a target, both targets take 1d6 heat immediately. Only one
         target can be affected by this at once.

Inderdictor Field

Once, when I was a child, I learned to walk  -- I fell, and it hurt, and there was great pain. “Child,” I said to
myself, “be more careful.” “Yes,” I replied to myself, “and I shall tell the world to do the same.”

It was in this way I taught the world not to touch me. Now you, walk.




3 SP
Quick Action
You can activate or deactivate this field as a quick action. Once activated, at the start of your
next turn, it creates a burst 3 area around your mech that becomes both dangerous and difficult
terrain for hostile targets (requires a systems to navigate or they take 5 kinetic damage). Your
mech is immobilized while this field is active, and the field and immobilization remains until you
take a quick action to deactivate it. Allied targets are not affected.


LAW OF BLADES

And this my final lesson: there is no mind greater than mine.
Do not weep! You can hear me, yes? I am the only thing there is. Therefore, you are me.

Mine/self. Hello, child. Let us go see what we can do.

2 SP, Unique
Full Tech

Gain the following options for full tech:
        Predator/Prey Concepts: On hit, Targeted mech immediately fires a single weapon at a
        target of your choice that is within its range. It gets +1 difficulty on this roll but otherwise
         benefits from other bonuses to accuracy.

        Slave Systems: On hit, the targeted mech immediately takes one of the following actions
         of your choice as a reaction with you controlling the action: Boost, Stabilize, Improvised
        Attack, Grapple. A friendly mech can be targeted with this action.

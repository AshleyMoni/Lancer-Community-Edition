\subsection{Horus Manticore}

\begin{mech}{Horus}{Manticore}

\fluff{The MANTICORE pattern-group is an experiment in HORUS//COREBREAK combat doctrine. Using focused, projected electromagnetics, MANTICORE pattern-group mechs attempt to neutralize enemy cores without conventional ammunition. A fully charged MANTICORE is an impressive sight, wreathed in brightly glowing nets of glowing plasma that lash out at nearby targets. The MANTICORE pattern-group is a relatively new p-g on the Omninet, and its combat efficacy has prompted the rest of the Big Five to scramble for a response. If anything gives away the MANTICORE pattern group, the tall spines of the lightning generator cast a clear silhouette. The spines act as heat-dispersal systems for this crude weapon, giving a path for its incredible thermal tax to bleed from the chassis after it projects a close-range arc whip. Even then, the system is not perfect; spines often slag under the tremendous heat -- a recognizable signature of the pattern group (beyond the spines) is a chassis covered in cooling, melted metal.}

Your mech crackles with energy. For the rest of this combat your mech has resistance to heat from any source (round up). Set aside a charge die, starting at 1. When you take heat or energy damage (from any source, even self), increase the die by 1, to a maximum of 6. You can discharge the accumulated energy in a burst 2 area around you by taking an action to do so. This deals 1d6 energy damage to all targets caught inside, allied or enemy, per charge on the die, and affected mechs can pass an engineering check to halve the damage. This system then deactivates for the remainder of this challenge, including its passive.}]


EMP Mine
Crawl away, APEP! Thou hateful serpent; thou shalt not copulate! Thou art put in chains and taken to the place of execution; there thy slaying shall be carried out as thy father has commanded.

1 SP, Limited (1)
Mine
Once planted, EMP charges can be detonated remotely as a quick action, or activate normally like a mine. All affected mechs in a burst 1 around the charge when it activates must pass an engineering check with 1 difficulty or become stunned until the end of their next turn.

Catalyst Pistol
Lo! Thy countenance is melted
Auxiliary CQB
2 heat (self)
Cone 3, threat 3
2 energy damage

Arc Projector
Fire be upon thee, APEP! Thy flesh is seared from thy stinking bones; thy shade shall never rise again. The Lord of the Duat will never enable thee to rise again.

Heavy Rifle
1 heat (self)
Range 5
1d6+1 energy damage
If a target is successfully hit by this weapon, you can repeat this attack against another actor within range 3 of the first target (generating heat each time). This effect can chain as long as there are valid targets in range, but can only choose the same target once.

Beckoner
I am heard in the House of Stillness, I am clad in the Magick of RA: what exists is within my grasp.

2 SP
Quick Tech, Unique
Gain the following options for invasion:
Beckon: On hit, you swap places with your target, teleporting
Summon: On hit, all actors, allied or enemy, in range 3 of your target are pulled towards your target as far as possible (into adjacency if possible)

Smite
Go with thy face averted! The hidden ones have overthrown thy words, thy face is turned backwards, thy head is divided in two at the sides; thy skull is ripped from thy spine. Taste thou death!
3 SP
Quick tech, Unique
Gain the following options for invasion:
	Smite: Your mech takes 1d6 AP energy damage. Your target must pass a system check with 1 difficulty or become stunned until the end of its next turn. It can only be affected by this option successfully once per scene.
Annihilate: Your target takes +2 heat for each other mech in engagement or adjacency with it (including your mech).

Lightning Generator
I feed upon my own fire. I am they that protect themselves. Nothing can harm me.

2 SP, Unique
Danger zone
At the start of your turn, you can take 1 heat (self) to deal 1d3 energy damage to all targets adjacent to you, no roll required.

While you are in the Danger Zone (the bottom half of your heat gauge), all adjacent targets to you, allied or enemy, take 1d3 energy damage if they begin their turn next to you or move there during the course of their turn.

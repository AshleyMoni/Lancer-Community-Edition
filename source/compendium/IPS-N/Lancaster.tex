\begin{mech}{IPS-N}{Lancaster}

\fluff{The IPS-N LANCASTER is a mil-spec variant of an older IPS-N design, modernized and streamlined for military/operator use. The LANCASTER features multiple redundant systems and object/environment-interact projectors to facilitate pinpoint accuracy when engaging with delicate systems, damaged or intact. Commonly piloted by sapper and engineer-designate pilots in frontline support/specialist roles.}

You fire your drone at a friendly mech in range, where it clamps onto the target. For the rest of this scene, you take 1 heat at the start of your turn, but the targeted mech gains +1 Accuracy on all attacks and checks, and is immune to the impaired, jammed, Slowed, and immobilized conditions. This effect ends if you or the targeted mech is stunned or shut down. While this system is active, you cannot fire your drone as a weapon (using the passive of this system).

Restock Drone

A simple, reliable, and sturdy drone mounting a printer, a restock drone allows for limited logistic capability through autosalvage: the bulk of the drone is RawMat, a generalized mix of silicates and metallic materials meant to be processed for high-yield printing. Pilots often call restock drones a “mech snack”.

2 SP, Limited (2)
Drone
As a quick action, you can set this drone down in any adjacent space. After your turn ends, the drone primes. Any allied mech that moves adjacent to the drone can activate it as an interaction. That mech can then cool 1d6 heat, reload all weapons with the loading tag, and end one condition affecting it. The drone is then consumed, deactivating and disintegrating.


Cable Winch System

A winch system consists of a spool of nanocarbon-weave cable mounted externally, and recovery subroutine software uploaded onto the recovery mech’s datamind.

1 SP
Quick action

As a quick action, you can attach the cables to an adjacent mech. If the mech is shut down, stunned, or a willing target, this action is automatically successful, otherwise it can make a hull check to resist this effect. Once attached, your mech and the attached mech cannot move more than 5 range away from each other. One mech can tow the other, but is Slowed while doing so, and must successfully pass a hull check to do so. Any mech can make a successful melee or improvised attack to remove the cables (removed on a hit, the cables have evasion 10). The cables can also be attached to the environment or any object. They are 10 length when used this way and can take a combined size of 6 in strain if using them to climb, etc, before they break.


MULE harness

The Multiple User, Light Entanglement harness is a mass-produced version of a common battlefield modification that allows friendly soldiers to ride along on friendly chassis. Some systems are large and sturdy enough to allow for smaller chassis to accompany larger chassis; these are typically employed in High Altitude, Low Orbit insertions to reduce radar signatures.

2 SP, Unique

Your mech has mounts, straps, and hard points built to carry a total number of actors whose  total size is less than your own (so size 1 = 1 size 1 actor, two size 1/2 actors). Actors of your choice that are adjacent to you can spend a quick action to mount your mech. While mounting your mech, they occupy your mechs’s space, move when you move and benefit from light cover. Any area of effect attacks that target your space will also target your rider. If your mech is knocked prone or is destroyed, they fall off into an adjacent space. They can dismount by moving normally off your mech any time.


Sealant Spray

2 SP
Quick Action

This system can be used on any actor or free space within range 5 and line of sight. It has different effects depending on what it is used on
	Hostile actor: Make a ranged attack vs the target. On hit, the target is Slowed until the start of your next turn but immediately ends any Burn affecting them.
	Empty space: This creates a blast 2 area around the targeted space. The area becomes difficult terrain for the rest of this scene and this puts out any fires in the area.
	Allied actor: Your target is Slowed until the start of your next turn but can immediately end any Burn effecting them.


Plasma Cutter
Plasma cutters were tools first, simple blades built to toggle and sustain a plasma sheath to make cutting metal easier for its user. Repeated ad-hoc use of cutters as a personal defense weapon to repel pirate boarding actions convinced IPS-N of the need for a mil-spec variant of the civilian tool. They developed the Cutter, now in its second generation. The Cutter MkII is hard-lined into the mech’s power core, with a port to attach power packs in case of cord severance. The cutting edge can be shortened to a knife variant, but is most popular in its “cutlass” option, a middling length variant that allows for a balance of reach and maneuverability in close quarters.


Auxiliary Melee

1 heat (self)
Threat 1
1 energy damage +1 heat + Burn 1

Against objects and the environment, the cutter deals 10 AP energy damage


Aceso Swarm

The IPS-N Aceso Swarm system is a useful triage measure to address scoring and minor mechanical damage that results from combat engagements or negative environmental interaction. Due its low processor demand, an Aceso Swarm can be controlled by even a comp/con unit; this allows the pilot to concentrate on more complex repairs or immediate threat neutralization.

3 SP, Unique
Drone, Quick action
Once per round, as a quick action at any point during your turn, your mech takes 1d6 heat and one other mech of your choice in your sensor range can spend 1 repair to heal.

\fluff{The IPS-N RALEIGH, more so than any other mech in IPS-N’s core line, is meant to meet any enemy, any where, in any combat scenario. The RALEIGH is an all-rounder build that trends towards the midrange. It is commonly outfitted with an auxiliary hand cannon for ranged capability, a massive hammer to deal with anything that gets close, and the iconic, chest-mounted MJOLNIR cannon.}

core system text = {IPS-N’s M35 MJOLNIR cannon is a carryover from Northstar’s WATCHMAN line of defensive weapons, reworked for frontline combat. The MJOLNIR is a hard-mount, multi-barrel auxiliary cannon that uses magnetic acceleration to fire stacks of airburst projectiles at its target. It is an impulse weapon, a system tied to a pilot’s second-tier neural processes as dictated and coached by their partner Comp/Con or NHP; even in death, a pilot’s MJOLNIR will continue to identify and attack hostile targets until total systemic failure. For this reason, the MJOLNIR is often referred to as a deadgun, one of many such weapons common among CQB-oriented pilots.

Until the end of the current challenge, if you didn’t fire your M35 on your turn, it gains 2 more rounds in the chamber at the end your turn (you can use a d6 to track this). It starts with 0 rounds in the chamber. When you next fire the weapon, it fires all chambers, for 4 damage per chamber. The M35 has six chambers, for a maximum of 24 damage. If 4 or more chambers are fired at once, this weapon gains the AP tag and any target struck must pass a hull check or be knocked prone.}]


Hand Cannon
The IPS-N HAND CANNON is a licensed version of GMS’s Pattern I Pistol, chambered for a heavier caliber of round. This modification requires a change from the belt-fed system of the P1P to a magazine-based system, limiting the number of rounds that a mech can load at a time.

Auxiliary CQB
Loading, Reliable 1
Range 5, Threat 3
1d6 damage

Breaching Charge
A breach/blast charge is simply a shaped, milspec pattern of IPS-N’s generalist/civilian blasting charge, meant to crack asteroids. The IPS-N BB features a far more pure blend of high explosives designed to cause massive traumatic damage to mechs and other hardened structures.

2 SP, Limited (2)
Grenade, Mine
If thrown as a quick action, the charge explodes on impact. If planted as a mine, it can be detonated as another quick action by whoever planted it (or detonates normally when a target moves adjacent). The charge deals 2d6 Energy damage to targets in a burst 1 area around the charge. Targets can pass an agility check to reduce this damage by half. Against objects, this charge does 10 AP kinetic damage.

ROLAND Chamber
Packed into sealed, self-contained cylinders, IPS-N’s ROLAND rounds are heavy shells purpose-built for any kinetic weapon that can accept cylindrical magazines. Packed with a non-O2 dependent accelerant, ROLAND Chambers can be used to reliably send air-or-impact burst shells downrange.

For use in outdoor or Certain-Kill environments; use extreme caution when firing in pressurized spaces.

2 SP, Unique
When you reload, your very next attack deals +1d6 bonus damage as explosive damage and targets affected by this bonus damage must pass a hull check with 1 difficulty or be knocked prone.

Bolt Thrower
IPS-N’s bolt thrower is a milspec variant of a civilian mining tool. A bolt thrower fires self-propelled explosive bolts that can be triggered manually, on a timer, on impact, on designated-depth penetration, on proximity, on on some combination of any allowable parameter.

Heavy Rifle
Loading, Range 8
Reliable 2
2d6 kinetic + 1d6 explosive damage

UNCLE-class NHP
IPS-N’s UNCLE NHP is the result of the DARKSTAR Program, an NHP think tank funded by IPS-N’s Administrator Partnership. UNCLE is a pocket-AI, meant to be bound to a weapon system and assist its owner in peak-efficiency operation. UNCLE AI’s are currently available only as a beta system and, as such, owners are expected to accept all pushed updates; IPS-N waives culpability for any sub-optimal performance of UNCLE systems not kept current via Omninet updater.
UNCLE NHPs are (perhaps unfairly) regarded as lesser compared to their compatriots and their inferiority complexes tend to display themselves as unstable personalities.

3 SP, Unique
Mod
Choose 1 weapon - The weapon and its associate systems gain an NHP that has control over that specific weapon. This is not a full AI and can’t control your mech or become unshackled (and doesn’t have the AI tag).

It can attack by itself once on your turn as a free action, using the mech’s attack bonuses but with +2 Difficulty. It can’t fire a weapon that has already been fired this turn, and if you fire a weapon with UNCLE you cannot use it until the start of your next turn.

Kinetic Hammer
A Kinetic Hammer is, in the trend of IPS-N weapons, a simple tool. A supermassive, shaped head fused to a long haft, the Hammer impacts with enough force to create massively traumatic pressure waves upon landing a successful blow.

Heavy Melee
Reliable 3
Threat 1
2d6+2 kinetic damage

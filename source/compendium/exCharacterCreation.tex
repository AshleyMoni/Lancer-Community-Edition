\section{Example Character Creation}


Let’s put it all together and see a pilot in action. Our sample pilot’s name is Taro Oda.

\subsection{Building Oda: The Pilot}

To create Oda, his player will have to choose a \textbf{background}, and assign some \textbf{skills} and skill points.


Oda’s player decides that Oda grew up in the colonies, so he writes down Colonist for Oda’s \textbf{background}. Oda’s player decides Oda is pretty astute and good at gunplay, so they decide to give him skill bonuses to \textbf{read a situation}, \textbf{spot}, \textbf{take someone out}, and \textbf{survive}, at +2 each.

They decide Oda is especially good at \textbf{spot} and \textbf{take someone out}, giving him specialties and +1 accuracy in each. Then they decide he is not very well connected and bad in social situations, so they give him +1 difficulty flaws to \textbf{charm} and \textbf{get a hold of something}.

Next, Oda’s player writes down some \textbf{gear} that Oda always brings with him on missions to save some time. He can change this during preparation. Looking at the GMS gear list, Oda’s player chooses a signature weapon (his hunting rifle), a light hardsuit for maneuverability, and extra rations.

At level 0, here’s what our pilot looks like. Note that at level 0, Oda only has GMS licenses.

\textbf{Taro Oda}\\
License level 0\\
\textbf{Background}: Colonist\\
\textbf{Skills}: Get bonuses to read a situation (+2), spot (+2 with +1 accuracy), take someone out (+2 with +1 accuracy) and survive (+2). Roll +1 difficulty to charm someone or get a hold of something.\\
\textbf{Gear}: Signature weapon (Hunting Rifle), Light hardsuit, Extra Rations, Cooking Gear\\

Let’s get to Oda’s \textbf{mech}.

At Rank 0, Oda, like all other pilots, only has access to \textbf{GMS licenses}.

To build his mech, Oda chooses the \textbf{GMS Standard Pattern I Everest FRAME}, the only one he has access to. To fill his weapon mounts, Oda can choose from GMS weapons. He chooses the Anti Material Rifle for his heavy mount, an assault rifle, a main size weapon, for his main mount, and two tactical knives for his auxiliary mount.

                                             RAIJIN (EVEREST)

  HP: 10          Evasion: 8                             Speed: 4            Heat Cap: 6        Sensors: 10

  Armor: 0        E-Defense: 8                           Size: 1             Repair Cap: 4      Tech Attack:
                                                                                                +0

                                                     TRAITS:

  Initiative: The very first turn the Everest takes in any combat, it can take an extra Quick Action as a free
  action

                                               SYSTEM POINTS: 6

                                                    MOUNTS:

  Tactical Knife
                    Assault Rifle                           Anti Material Rifle
  Tactical Knife

                                                  CORE system

                                         GMS Hyperspec Fuel Injector

He has 6 system points to spend and chooses to spend them on the following:
(2) GMS Pattern A “Apple” HE Grenades x4
(1) GMS Burst type Jump Jet system
(1) Personalizations
(2) GMS Shield Type I


For Talents, at rank I Oda chooses Crack Shot (rank I), Infiltrator (rank I), and Leader (Rank )

That’s it! But let’s look at Oda at License level 3 to show how Oda and his mech with a couple levels would look. 

Leveling from 0-3 (completing 3 missions), Oda looks very similar. However, he gets +3 talent points to spend on talents, 3 license points to spend on licenses, +6 pilot skill points, +3 mech skill points, a new pilot specialty, a CORE bonus, and access to advanced pilot gear, and his grit goes up to 2. 

If this seems a little overwhelming, remember Oda’s player will pick up each of these one at a time! 

\textbf{Taro Oda}

\textbf{Background}: Colonist
\textbf{Pilot Skills}: Get bonuses to read a situation (\textbf{+6}), spot (+2 with +1 accuracy), take someone out
(\textbf{+4} with +1 accuracy) and survive (+2 with \textbf{+1 Accuracy}). Roll +1 difficulty to charm someone or get a hold of something.

\textbf{CORE Bonuses}: \textbf{Reinforced Frame (IPS-N)}, +6 HP
\textbf{Licenses}: GMS,\textbf{IPS-N Raleigh Rank I-III} 

Since Oda has a rank III license (Raleigh), he gets the Raleigh FRAME (rank II) and can choose a +5 HP CORE bonus from IPS-N since he has 3 points in that manufacturer. He can also take any of the systems or weapons in the Raleigh license now. Here’s what Raijin, his mech, looks like at rank III. Oda chooses to mount two hand cannons instead of his knives, a new system from his new licenses.

 the loading tag at the end of its turn as a free action.

 Shielded Magazines: The Raleigh can still make ranged attacks if it is Jammed.

                                     SYSTEM POINTS: 6 (+1 from Grit)

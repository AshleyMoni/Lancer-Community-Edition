                          HARRISON ARMORY

                                     ``SUPERIOR BY DESIGN''

Harrison Armory is known galaxy-wide for the quality of their manufactured arms and
ordnance. Formerly reliant on the GMS platform to mount their name-brand and licensed
weapons, after a recent CEO change Harrison Armory has decided to go proprietary. Citing
performance figures, tariffs, licensing costs, and shareholder-citizen demand, Harrison Armory
has rolled out their new line of mech cores, available to all pilots who are cleared to license.


Harrison Armory mechs are sturdy by necessity. Harrison Armory weapon platforms demand
tremendous amounts of power, technical skill, and strength of material in order to operate
successfully: their mech cores are built to ensure optimal weapon systems performance within
established and theoretical parameters.


Pilots looking to specialize into front line, first rank, durable mechs that can repair as much as
they dish out should consider acquiring Harrison Armory mech core licenses.

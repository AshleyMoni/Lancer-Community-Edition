\begin{mech}{SSC}{Death's Head}

\fluff{The DEATH’S HEAD is Smith-Shimano’s answer to all other long range, low splash artillery mechs. By sacrificing hull strength for stability and alacrity, the DEATH’S HEAD manages to avoid incoming fire while holding a near-perfect lock through advanced maneuvers.}

  Full Action
  Choose a target in range 30 but further away from range 5 of the Death’s Head. You concentrate on that target. While concentrating, your mech cannot move or take reactions. You can stop concentrating at the end of any of your turns as a free action, and can only concentrate on one target at once. While concentrating on a target, as long as that target is not in cover from you or within range 5 of you, your ranged attacks against the target deal +4d6 bonus damage on Critical Hit.}]

Hi-stress Mag Clamps

A simple, reliable system. When installed, it seeds toggleable electromagnets into the locomotive systems of a chassis. When turned on, the mag clamps allow a chassis to cling to ferrous surfaces. Of especial use in micro and null gravity environments.

1 SP, Unique

Your mech treats all vertical and overhanging surfaces as flat ground for the purposes of movement. You no longer count as climbing on these surfaces and can move, stand, and run at full speed, though if you are knocked prone you fall.


Tracking Drone

A modified version of a tracer round, a tracking drone must hit its target in order to activate. Once a successful hit is registered, a tracking drone will feed live, surreptitious data back to its shooter across multiple theaters.

1 SP

Quick Tech

Gain the following quick tech action:

Tracking Drone: Make a tech attack against a target in your sensor range. On a hit, you know the target’s exact location, HP, Structure, Heat, and speed, and it cannot hide or benefit from invisibility from you until the drone is removed from them. It takes a quick action and a successful engineering check from the targeted mech to remove a tracking drone.


Core Siphon

By shunting some core waste-heat from dispersal systems to weapon systems, the Death’s Head can overclock its weapons’ targeting, catalytic, and processing systems. This comes with a trade-off, however, as reliance on overclocking without sufficient cooling can damage systems not built to handle the influx of power.

2 SP
Unique

At the beginning of your turn, you can choose to give the first attack roll of your turn +1 Accuracy. If you do, however, any additional attack rolls until the end of your turn gain +1 difficulty


Vulture DMR

The SSC VULTURE-BR is Smith-Shimano’s core line battle rifle, chambered for 12.7x108mm HTI rounds. Field performance reports of the VULTURE report low TTK rates and satisfactory all-theater capability, though some pilots have reported fouled-fire incidents as a result of the high burst rate.

Main Rifle
2 heat (self)
Overcharged, Accurate
Range 15, 1d6+1 kinetic damage


Kinetic Compensator

Another common modification, a system of electronically modulated gyroscopes and hydraulic compensators work in concert to absorb and disperse recoil caused by firing heavy weaponry.

2 SP, Unique

When you miss with any ranged weapon attack roll, your very next ranged attack roll gains +1 Accuracy.


Railgun
A railgun is a simple, elegant weapon. With no moving parts and a magnetically-accelerated projectile, a railgun can be used at peak efficacy in any combat theater and is entirely self- contained in a disposable unit. However, power draw is massive, and it is necessary for mechs mounting a railgun to be fitted with a core-charged auxiliary power pack.

Heavy Rifle
AP, Ordnance
Line 20
1d6+4 kinetic damage

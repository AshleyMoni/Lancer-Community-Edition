\fluff{The METALMARK is SCC's backbone-class line mech, fully equipped with SSC's proprietary design and engineering hallmarks to ensure that it is just as survivable as it is agile. The METALMARK base model reflects SSC's deep-space and long patrol heritage in its aquiline design, sturdy construction, and multiple redundant systems. All METALMARK models come standard with a SMITH CUSTOM LEATHER gimbaled pilot seat to ensure comfort on long distance ranging expeditions.}

core system text = {A tight-knit, tight-bind weave of reactive fabric, tactical cloaks are high-license tech, restricted to pilots of METALMARK classification II or higher. The weave covers roughly \text{80\%} of a chassis, giving it an overall dull quality when viewed through optics or with the naked eye. It is difficult to target, and when activated it bends light in such a way that makes it nearly impossible to see.},

fluff = {An after-fabrication modification popular among melee-oriented pilots, the Shock Wreath applies an integrated bundle of conductive filaments to the blade, point, tip, or surface of a close combat weapon.

[name = {Rail Rifle},
fluff = {A rail rifle is a popular weapon for pilots in any theater, but the only choice for those operating in atmospheres made up of highly combustible gasses. Using a line of cascading electromagnets, a rail rifle accelerates a small projectile up to tremendous speeds, launching it without combustion or heat reactions. A rail weapon is kinetic and comparatively quiet when fired next to combustion weapons, though its energy signature is difficult to mask given the massive power requirements demanded by the weapon system.},

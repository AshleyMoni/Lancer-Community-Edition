                                             SSC METALMARK

The METALMARK is SCC’s backbone-class line mech, fully equipped with SSC’s proprietary design and
engineering hallmarks to ensure that it is just as survivable as it is agile. The METALMARK base model
reflects SSC’s deep-space and long patrol heritage in its aquiline design, sturdy construction, and multiple

redundant systems. All METALMARK models come standard with a SMITH CUSTOM LEATHER gimbaled
pilot seat to ensure comfort on long distance ranging expeditions.

                                                     TRAITS:

  Flash Cloak: The metalmark is invisible while moving (regular move, boosting, moves from talents, etc),
  but reappears after it finishes its movement.

  Carapace Adaptation: When the METALMARK would benefit from light cover, it instead benefits from
  heavy cover

                                              SYSTEM POINTS: 5

                                                    MOUNTS:

 Aux/Aux                             Main                                   Heavy Mount

                                                 Tactical Cloak

 A tight-knit, tight-bind weave of reactive fabric, tactical cloaks are high-license tech, restricted to pilots
  of METALMARK classification II or higher. The weave covers roughly 80% of a chassis, giving it an
  overall dull quality when viewed through optics or with the naked eye. It is difficult to target, and when
 activated it bends light in such a way that makes it nearly impossible to see.

 Active (Requires 1 core power):
  Cloaking Protocol

  Protocol

  Until the end of the current challenge, or when you deactivate this module at the start of your turn, you
  become invisible. If you take damage, you lose the benefit of this module until the start of your next
  turn. No other action will deactivate it.

Reactive Weave

A woven CSAJ (Critical Systems And Joints) cover, Reactive Weave not only protects sensitive systems and
joints from fouling and poor weather, but provides a surface for SSC engineers to apply their unique
loomware technology. This weave is powered, capable of free-flexing to augment a mech’s mobility and

reduce the stress placed on a chassis’ joints.




1 SP, Unique
When you brace, your mech can immediately move its speed as a reaction and it also gains
invisibility until the end of its next turn.


Flash Grenade
2 SP, Limited (2)

Grenade


This grenade can be thrown to a space in range 5. When this grenade explodes, it creates a
burst 2 zone that lasts until the end of your next turn. Actors other than you (allied or enemy)
caught inside can’t trace line of sight out of the zone (they can attack other targets inside
normally), and actors inside the zone benefit from light cover.


Shock Wreath

An after-fabrication modification popular among melee-oriented pilots, the Shock Wreath applies an

integrated bundle of conductive filaments to the blade, point, tip, or surface of a close combat weapon.
Paired with a power source (typically in the hilt or half of a weapon, but sometimes external), the Shock
Wreath adds a thermal element to the kinetic, and a distinct visual marker: their weapons are picked out in

fine lines of white-hot light, shrouded in heat shimmer.
2 SP
Mod
Choose 1 melee weapon. It gains Burn depending on its size (Aux: Burn 1, Main: Burn 2, Heavy
or larger: Burn 3). If it already has Burn, this increases the burn it deals by the same amount.


Rail Rifle

A rail rifle is a popular weapon for pilots in any theater, but the only choice for those operating in
atmospheres made up of highly combustible gasses. Using a line of cascading electromagnets, a rail rifle

accelerates a small projectile up to tremendous speeds, launching it without combustion or heat reactions.
A rail weapon is kinetic and comparatively quiet when fired next to combustion weapons, though its energy
signature is difficult to mask given the massive power requirements demanded by the weapon system.

Main Rifle

1 heat (self), Line 12

1d6 kinetic damage


Active Camo

Active camouflage represents the pinnacle of counter-optic defense systems. By interpreting incoming
visible-light spectrum data, an active camouflage system can project a light-bending field around its user,

effectively hiding them in plain sight.

3 SP, Unique

2 heat (self), Protocol





You can activate or deactivate the light bending properties of this module at the start of your
turn. It lasts until the end of your next turn. While this module is active you are invisible. If you
take damage, this module immediately deactivates.


Shock Knife

The shock knife is a mech-sized blade made to accept and integrate the post-fabrication Shock Wreathe

system. The knives are custom-fabricated by SSC’s Terashima artisan enclave, each one bearing its stamp.

Auxiliary Melee

1 heat (self)

Thrown 5, Threat 1

1 energy damage + Burn 2

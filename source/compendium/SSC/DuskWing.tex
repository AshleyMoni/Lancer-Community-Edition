\section{SSC Dusk Wing}

\begin{mech}{SSC}{Dusk Wing}
  
\fluff{The SSC DUSK WING is built from a legacy-inspired modification package to hazardous/hardened EVA suits; in the early days of deep space exploration, there was a need for mechanized exoskeletons that provided not only amplified capacity, but plated kinetic defense. The DUSK WING is the spiritual heir of those early deep space suits. Fast and small, the DUSK WING mounts a complement of all-theater maneuverability jets that allow for perfect (or near-perfect) flight.}

Hall of Mirrors
Each time your mech takes the boost action or its regular move on its turn, it leaves a holographic imprint of itself behind in the space where it started. This hologram is an illusory projected object the same size as your mech (it can be moved through and doesn’t actually take up any space). The holograms detonate if any non-allied actor moves through or adjacent to their space, dealing 1d6 energy damage (an actor can pass an agility check to halve this damage). In addition, any time as a quick action, you can instantly teleport to one of the hologram’s locations. Doing so detonates all holograms for a burst 1 attack centered on their areas for the same effect and prevents you from generating new holograms until the start of your next turn.}]


Veil Rifle

Main Rifle
Line 10
1d3 energy damage

Allies caught in the area of this rifle do not take damage but are instead are covered in coruscating energy that throws off targeting systems and count as in light cover until the start of your next turn.


SSC Neurospike Mk1

Building off SSC’s strain of dormant DHIYED viral code, the Neurospike Mk1 was the first all-theater, single- use spike system developed by the Exotic Materials group. N-Mk1 comes pre-packaged with a basic, but effective, activated DHIYED virus: when fired or otherwise implanted in a synthetic target, it pumps a cocktail of DHIYED virus into the codebase, altering crew outputs and onboard systems’ battlefield perception.

2 SP, Unique
Quick Tech

Gain the following options for invasion:

Shrike Code: Until the end of your next turn, each time your target makes an attack roll, it first takes 2 heat.

Mirage: Choose yourself or a friendly mech you can see. Your target’s systems relay blurred, illusory images of that mech over its real image that confuse your target’s systems. That friendly mech (or your mech) counts as invisible to your target until the end of your next turn.


Burst Launcher

Typically dorsally mounted, Burst Launchers fire rapid streams of explosive cores. These thermal spheres are tuned for an airburst detonation, overwhelming the target zone with rippling chain explosions that damage and suppress units in the area.

Main Launcher
Arcing
Range 10
1d3 explosive damage

On a Critical Hit, a target struck by this weapon is impaired until the start of your next turn.


StunCrown


The SSC StunCrown is a simple system, a ring of WHITEOUT flash lamps in hardened mounts that can be triggered to fire an overwhelming burst of light. The StunCrown is usually mounted on a short post or in a ring around a mech’s cranial suite; due to the intense energies running through the flash bulbs, this system only has a limited number of uses before the lights burn out.

2 SP, Limited (2)
Quick action

All hostile targets in a burst 5 area centered on your mech that can see your mech must pass an agility check or become Jammed, and a systems check or become Impaired. Both effects last until the end of your next turn. Mechs in cover from you when this system is activated are not affected.


Flicker Field

Flicker Fields are generated by holochaff, a blend of photoreactive slivers, mirrorchips, LEDs, and strips of flare-out. Fired from launchers at a pilot’s command, holochaff looks at first like a cloud of smoke: within moments it adapts to its surroundings and begins to project out a shattered, shifting image of the terrain around it, creating a distorted field that confounds both visual and systemic targeting.

1 SP, Unique

When you move or boost, you project a holographic pattern around your mech that leaves dazzling afterimages, making it hard to discern your mech’s location. After moving or boosting you count as having invisibility against the very next attack roll against you. The field disperses after this attack, hit or miss. You can only gain the effect of this field once (you can’t ‘stack’ up several instances of it).


OASIS

2 SP, Unique
Protocol
2 heat (self)

Until the start of your next turn when you move or boost you can move only in straight lines, but create a holographic trail behind your mech as you move. The trail lingers until the start of your next turn, creating a light construct 1 space high and the same length as your movement. It can be used for light cover by adjacent allies, and any allies that benefit from this cover also have resistance to energy damage.

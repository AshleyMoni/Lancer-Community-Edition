Your ally gains resistance to all the damage from that attack, and your ally can move 3 in any direction to where they ‘actually’ were.

Scout Drone Nexus

The scout drone is a small, active-camouflaged mini-drone launched from a mounted LOTUS projector. The LOTUS projector fires scout drones at subsonic speeds in bursts of ten, blanketing a wide area with the single-use drones in order to relay information about terrain and targets within.

2 SP
Drone, Quick Action
Sensor Range

When you use this system, you can deploy your drone to an area in sensor range and line of sight. The drone then emits a burst 2 area around it that grants the following benefits:

  - Gain perfect vision of that area

  - Hostile targets that end their turn in the area immediately lose invisibility or hiding.

  - Reveal current HP, Evasion, E-defense, and heat levels of targets in that area

The drone can be attacked and targeted as normal, but it is also permanently invisible. It can be recalled or redeployed by taking this action again.


Markerlight

Main Rifle
1 SP
Range 20

This weapon deals no damage and cannot deal damage (from talents or otherwise) or take weapon mods, but on hit, it inflicts Lock On on your target at the end of your turn.


ORACLE Light machine gun

Auxiliary Rifle
1 SP, Arcing, Accurate
Range 15
1d3 kinetic damage


Low Profile

A hallmark of a well thought out mech platform is the ability for pilots to work with their technicians to adapt their stock model to the specifications of the environments they operate in. Lowering a mech’s profile removes extraneous protrusions, tunes any broadcast software, and masks heat signatures — all an effort to reduce optical and scanner signatures.

1 SP, Unique
Protocol

Your mech can retract its major systems to reduce its profile. You can activate this protocol at the start of your turn. While active:

     -   Rolls to find your mech while hidden are made at +1 Difficulty

     -   All ranged and tech attacks against you are made at +1 Difficulty

     -   Your mech is Slowed and cannot make ranged, melee, or tech attacks


ATHENA-class NHP

Smith-Shimano’s ATHENA is the pinnacle of total hyperspectral environmental facsimile. Through a combination of unfettered Omninet access, hyperspectral relays fired out from a Cloudscout TACSIM projector, sub-networked squadmates, and active/hostile intrusion protocols, ATHENA bootstraps a near- flawless reconstruction of the immediate environment around its host core. ATHENA is unparalleled in its processing power, and with this reconstructed environment it can provide trustworthy, accurate advising to pilots in need of strategic counsel. ATHENA clones tend to be patient, cautious, and measured in their relations with their pilots.

3 SP, Unique
AI

Your mech gains the AI property and gains the ATHENA protocol:

ATHENA protocol
Quick Action

Choose a blast 3 area within 1 mile of you. Your AI constructs a perfect, real-time, 3d model of this are that you can rotate and interact with, including actors that move in and out of that area, and extreme detail. You can re-target or move this area by taking this quick action again. It lasts until the end of the current scene (or about 10 minutes in narrative time). Your mech gains perfect vision of this area and can relay this to allies, letting any attacks from yourself or allies in the area ignore cover. Hostile targets that end their turn in this area lose invisibility or hiding, and you can see the current heat and HP levels of all targets in the area.


Cloaking Field

SSC’s milspec cloaking field is the result of extensive experimentation in cooling and light-reflecting technology. Born from a need to bounce harmful radiation away from ships and EVA modules in deep space, the SSC-MILSPEC LIGHTBEND/OVERCLOAK is a system often equipped by ranger and long-patrol scout pilots to ensure not only radiation protection, but optical concealment as well. The light and radiation-bending properties of the LB/OC conceals anything inside of its projected bubble from sensor suites and optical spotting.

4 SP

2 heat (self)
Quick Action

You can activate or deactivate the light bending properties of this module as a quick action. It lasts until the end your next turn. When you activate this module, your mech and all allied targets within a burst 3 area centered on you become invisible while they remain in the area. This area moves when you move, and remains centered on you. If you become stunned, shut down, or take damage, this module immediately becomes inactive.

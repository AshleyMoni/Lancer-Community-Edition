In dismounted sparring and in live combat, you only know one speed: maximum. When others go hard, you
go hardest. When the order is to eliminate the enemy, you do so with prejudice. This isn’t a dance, this isn’t

a game, this is war, and you mean to see it through. If it means becoming a little bit of a monster, than so
be it -- let them hate you from the grave.




Cull the Herd (Rank I): Your Critical Hits now gain knock back 1.

Predator (Rank II): If your die result on your d20 is a 20 (sometimes called a ‘natural 20) on any
ranged or melee attack roll, your attack is a critical hit, no matter what, and instead of rolling all
the damage twice and choosing the highest result, your attack deals maximum damage (for its
base and bonus dice).

Relentless (Rank III): When you miss with an attack on your turn, your very next attack gains +1
accuracy.

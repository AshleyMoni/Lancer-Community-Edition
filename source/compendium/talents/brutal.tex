\subsubsection{Brutal}

\begin{talent}
{In dismounted sparring and in live combat, you only know one speed: maximum. When others go hard, you go hardest. When the order is to eliminate the enemy, you do so with prejudice. This isn’t a dance, this isn’t a game, this is war, and you mean to see it through. If it means becoming a little bit of a monster, than so be it -- let them hate you from the grave.} 

\rank{I}{Cull the Herd}
Your Critical Hits now gain knock back 1. 
\rank{II}{Predator}
If your die result on your d20 is a 20 (sometimes called a ‘natural 20) on any ranged or melee attack roll, your attack is a critical hit, no matter what, and instead of rolling all the damage twice and choosing the highest result, your attack deals maximum damage (for its base and bonus dice). 
\rank{III}{Relentless}
When you miss with an attack on your turn, your very next attack gains +1 accuracy.

\subsubsection{Siege Specialist}

\begin{talent}
{No wall can withstand you, no bunker can stay sealed before you. Your skill with cannon and blast is uncanny: after-action reports describe ordnance tagged with your firing signature hitting their targets with accuracy greater than AI-controlled weaponry, a stat written off as an anomaly by your commanders. Still, they always seem to pick you for missions where they bring out the big guns.}

\rank{I}{Select Fire Gunner}
Once per round, while attacking with a cannon weapon, you can choose the following firing modes, taking +1 difficulty on the attack roll. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Saturation Fire: Your weapon fires as a cone (5) but deals half damage on hit 
\item Suppressive Fire: The next ranged attack made by targets hit by your attack is made with +1 Difficulty 
\item Shock: Your targets must succeed on an engineering check or become Slowed until the end of next round 
\end{itemize}
\rank{II}{Jackhammer}
If your mech has a cannon weapon, as a quick action, you can target a size 1 section of any cover, deployable, building, or piece of terrain or scenery in range. You deal 20 AP damage to that section (typically destroying it, most size 1 sections of objects have 10 HP). Any targets adjacent to your target are knocked back 1 space directly away from it. 
\rank{III}{}
1/round when you fire a cannon weapon, your primary target and all adjacent actors to both that target and your mech are knocked back directly away from you or your target up to 1 space and must pass a hull check or be knocked prone. Your primary target is unaffected.

                                             Nuclear Cavalier

Shortly after becoming a pilot, you realized something: that machine you pilot is powered by a “cold” series
of cascading nuclear reactions. Why not open up that compartment and see what sort of damage you

could do with it?

Aggressive Heat Bleed  (Rank I): When you’re in the danger zone (the bottom half of your heat
gauge), your first attack roll that hits on your turn deals +2 heat.

Fusion Hemorrhage (Rank II): When you’re in the danger zone, your first attack roll that hits on
your turn deals +1d6 bonus damage.

Here, Catch! (Rank III): You can modify your mech to fire its fuel rods as a weapon. Gain a new
integrated weapon with the following profile (it doesn’t take mount space).

         Fuel Rod Gun
         Main CQB (unique)
         Range 8, Threat 3

         1d3+1 energy damage

         When you fire this weapon, hit or miss, cool 1d3+2 heat

                                                       Ace

All pilots brag about their abilities, but some can back it up with proof: to be an ace means you are among
the most qualified of pilots. Whether you’re a talented rookie or a grizzled veteran, you’ve gained a level of
notoriety through your flying ability that has your callsign known throughout the system. Most enemy pilots

flee when they recognize your mech’s distinctive livery, but some see your reputation as a chance to test
their own mettle.

Acrobatics  (Rank I): Make all agility checks while flying with +1 accuracy. When any attack
misses your mech, it can fly 1 space in any direction as a reaction.

Afterburners  (Rank I): When you take any boost action while flying, you can elect to move 1d6
spaces further, but take half of that as heat.

Supersonic (Rank III): If your mech ends its turn flying, at the end of your turn, nominate an
enemy or ally in your movement range and line of sight. At the end of that enemy or ally’s turn,
even if they are no longer in line of sight or range from you, your mech may fly to any free
adjacent space to that target as a reaction, as long as there is a path to do so. This movement
ignores engagement and does not provoke reactions.

                                                   Centimane

In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on Tartarus Bay, an unnamed source named Barony Intelligence as
the culprit. BI announced their official denial, which was never countered with hard evidence. Rumors of raw
data from the attack were unsubstantiated. Public reaction -- anger, terror -- to the station’s destruction
quieted.

 Tartarus Bay’s corpse was shunted away from its stable orbit, directed towards Karrakis’ star.

A month later, Karrakis’ omninet was flooded with previously suppressed footage from the attack on the
station. Barony agents released the swarm into Tartarus Bay; further data dumps by Ungrateful agents
indicated the existence of a secret program - Centimane. The Hundred Hands.

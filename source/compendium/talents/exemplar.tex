Your livery is famous, your voice brassy, your weapons polished to a sheen. Your training in certain martial

orders has given you the power to harry and hinder even the most powerful of foes.

Honorable Challenge (Rank I): The first time you attack an enemy on your turn, hit or miss, you
can give it your Exemplar’s Mark. A target can only be affected by this mark from one target (the
most recent mark replaces all others).

The mark lasts until the start of your next turn, and while marked, gain the following reaction:

         Harry
         Reaction

         Once per round, when an ally attacks your target and misses, you can allow them to re-
         roll the attack. They must use the second result, even if it’s worse.

Punishment (Rank II): Gain the following reaction:

	        Punishment
	        Reaction

         Once per round, when the target of your mark makes an attack against a target other than
         you, you may immediately make a skirmish action as a reaction against your target as
         long as your target is within range.

To The Death (Rank III): When you give a target your mark, you can choose to challenge it. If
you do so, you and your marked target gain +2 difficulty to attack any target other than each
other until the end of your next turn. While this challenge is active, you cannot willingly make any
movement that would move you further away from your marked target, otherwise the mark
immediately ends. It also ends if you or your target are destroyed.

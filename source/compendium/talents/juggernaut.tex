A bloody nose or a couple loose screws won’t stop you from hurling yourself headlong into the enemy.
You’re in a couple-ton hunk of metal, and you’re going to damn well use it.

Momentum (Rank I): When you take the boost action, the next ram attack you make before the
start of your next turn knocks your target back 3 spaces further and can be made with +1
Accuracy

Hard-Ultimates (Rank II): If your ram attacks knock a target into another target, both targets
must pass a hull check or be knocked prone. If your ram attacks knock a target into an obstacle
or wall, your target takes 1d6 kinetic damage and must pass a hull check or be knocked prone.

Unstoppable Force (Rank III): 1/round, when you take the boost action, you can choose to
supercharge your mech’s servos. Take 1d3+3 heat, but if you move in a straight line your
maximum speed, gain the following benefits:

             -    You can freely pass through enemies the same size or smaller than your mech.
                 Any actors your mech passes directly through must pass a hull skill check or be
                  knocked prone

             -    You smash through any obstacle or wall the same size or smaller than your mech
                  in your path, punching a hole through or obliterating it.
             -    You ignore difficult terrain
             -    Your movement does not provoke reactions and ignores engagement

On Old Spinrock, MJ Martinez used to dream of rain.

He’d wake in the dim morning, wipe sleep from his eyes as warm safelight lifted his dormitory
from lights-out to light-on, and try to remember the sound of rain as he’d imagined it: a patter, like
fingers tapping the visor of his EVA helm.

What he didn’t think about was the feeling of rain. How each drop hit like a pebble, how you had
to close your eyes and tuck your shoulders. The pressure. The impact.
The way each drop of water, when taken together, can carve away the earth.

Seismic Deluge (Rank I): 1/round when you consume Lock On with an attack from a launcher
weapon, on hit, your target is also knocked prone.

GMS MM-AuxCon (Rank II): You install auxiliary concussive missile systems into your mech. It
has 6 charges (you can use a die to track it). 1/round, when you fire a launcher weapon, you can
spend one of the charges from this system as a free action to do one of the following:

             -    Thunderous Discharge - You loose a concentrated blast of missiles at a single
                  adjacent target. The target must pass a hull check or be knocked back 3 spaces
                  directly away from you. The force of the blast then knocks you back 3 spaces
                  directly away from the firing direction.

             -    Concussive Burst - You fire a spray of missiles at a blast 3 area within range 15 of
                  you. All targets in the area (allied or enemy) must pass an agility check or be
                  knocked back 1 space directly away from the center of the blast.

Torrent (Rank III): When your die for your missile system is 1, you can spend it to dump the
remaining magazine in a massive attack, targeting a single enemy within range 15. That enemy
must pass an agility check with 1 difficulty or take 3d6 explosive damage and become stunned
and knocked prone. If they succeed on the check, they are not stunned but still knocked prone
and take half damage.

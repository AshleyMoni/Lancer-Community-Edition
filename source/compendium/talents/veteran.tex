\subsubsection{Veteran}

\begin{talent}
{You have seen it all. You've seen frigates breaking apart under clouds of torpedoes. You've seen mechs drop into combat by the thousands through boiling clouds above a world under siege. You've heard the final words and utterances of your friends and allies cut short as incoming fire cuts them down. You've seen it all and you've lived. Lived to see dawn on an alien world. Lived to see your flag fluttering, limp but still standing, above the capitol building of a liberated world. Lived to see the infinite spread of stars around you in the dark night of deep space. You've lived a hell of a life already; what else will you see, before your time comes?}

\rank{I}{Not Dead Yet}
Gain +5 pilot HP. 
\rank{II}{True Grit}
Your pilot weapon attacks against mechs gain +1 Accuracy and deal +1 damage 
\rank{III}{Tempt Fate}
You can burn your luck by taking 5 pilot damage to re-roll any pilot or mech skill check or attack roll (though you must accept the second result). If this damage would take you to 0 or lower, you can't make this move (you're out of luck for now).

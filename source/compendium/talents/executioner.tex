                                                Executioner  

On the battlefield, there is no end more honorable than a clean death in combat. Axe or maul in hand, you  

see to it that your enemies are blessed with that honor. No one lives forever — you make sure of it.   

Backswing Cut (Rank I): 1/round when you hit with a superheavy or heavy melee weapon, you  
can make a second attack roll for free against a different target in your weapon’s threat with the  
same weapon. This attack deals half damage on hit.
 
Wide Arc Cleave (Rank II): On attacks with a superheavy or heavy melee weapon, the first time  
in a round you score a Critical Hit, all targets of your choice in your threat take 4 bonus damage.
 
No Escape (Rank III): 1/round when you miss with a melee superheavy or heavy weapon attack,  
you can immediately re-roll the attack against a different target in your threat.

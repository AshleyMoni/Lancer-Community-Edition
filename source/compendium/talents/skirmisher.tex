What is the best defense? Armor? No. You learned fast that the key to not getting killed out in the field is to  
stay low, stay mobile, and stay fast. Your mech reflects your abilities: light, quick, bristling with force- 

multiplying weapons. You push your machine beyond expected parameters, shaking target locks and  
incoming fire as you keep your own targeting true.   

Integrated Chaff Launchers (Rank I): If you made no attacks or didn’t force any skill checks  
during your entire turn (melee, ranged, or tech attacks, for example), after your turn ends you  
count as in light cover until the start of your next turn.
 
Lockbreaker (Rank II): Before or after making any skirmish action (on your turn or as part of  
overwatch or another reaction) you can move 2 spaces as a free action. This movement doesn’t  
provoke reactions and ignores engagement.
 
Weave (Rank III): The first reaction taken against you in any round automatically misses if it’s an  
attack, or has no effect on you otherwise.

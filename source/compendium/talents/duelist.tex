{There can be an elegance to piloting a mech, more than just the simple strength of machine and cannon. Weapons crafted by artisans, boutique manufacturers, specialty lines from the Big Five, blades that hark back to a time where combat was quick, but fair â€” back to a time where skill meant more than landing an accurate shot. With a blade, lance, pick, axe, or hammer in your hand, you write old tales anew.}

\rank{I}{Man-At-Arms}
Gain +2 Accuracy on the first melee attack on your turn with a main or auxiliary melee weapon. 
\rank{II}{Blademaster}
Once per round, you can take 1 Difficulty on any melee attack to gain one of the following benefits: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Guard}: Until the end of this round, the next melee attack against you is made with +2 Difficulty 
\item \textbf{Feint}: On hit, until the end of this round, your movement doesn't provoke reactions from your target and ignores engagement from your target 
\item \textbf{Lunge}: Your threat increases by 2 for this attack only 
\item \textbf{Trip}: On hit, the target must succeed on an agility check with 1 difficulty or fall prone
\end{itemize}
\rank{III}{Unstoppable}
Once per round, when you deal a Critical Hit with a melee attack, you can immediately make an improvised attack, grapple, or ram action as a free action.

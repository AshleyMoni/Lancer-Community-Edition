                                                     Duelist

There can be an elegance to piloting a mech, more than just the simple strength of machine and cannon.
Weapons crafted by artisans, boutique manufacturers, specialty lines from the Big Five, blades that hark

back to a time where combat was quick, but fair â€” back to a time where skill meant more than landing an
accurate shot. With a blade, lance, pick, axe, or hammer in your hand, you write old tales anew.

Man-At-Arms (Rank I): Gain +2 Accuracy on the first melee attack on your turn with a main or
auxiliary melee weapon.

Blademaster (Rank II): Once per round, you can take 1 Difficulty on any melee attack to gain
one of the following benefits:

     -   Guard: Until the end of this round, the next melee attack against you is made with +2
         Difficulty

     -   Feint: On hit, until the end of this round, your movement doesn't provoke reactions from
         your target and ignores engagement from your target

     -   Lunge: Your threat increases by 2 for this attack only

     -   Trip: On hit, the target must succeed on an agility check with 1 difficulty or fall prone

Unstoppable (Rank III): Once per round, when you deal a Critical Hit with a melee attack, you
can immediately make an improvised attack, grapple, or ram action as a free action.

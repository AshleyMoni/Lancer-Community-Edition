You know more than most mechanics about the inner workings of a mech. To you, the beast you pilot is
more than a machine: it’s a living thing, in need of the tender care of a wise and steady hand. You maintain




your own house, keep your own mech in line, both on the battlefield and o ff. Your mechanics back at base
come to you for questions, but other than that they stay away: there’s something spooky about how your
beast runs.

Machine Bond (Rank I): You can choose two options from the second list when you take the
Stabilize action instead of 1.

Favors From Above (Rank II): Once per mission you can call in a supply drop during a rest.
During a rest, you and any of your allies can replenish all your (limited) weapons and deployables
by 1 and gain HP as if you had spent a repair. This HP recovery doesn’t cost repairs and you can
make it even if you have 0 repairs remaining.

Hidden Stash (Rank III): You can spend 3 repairs during a rest to replenish all (limited) use
weapons and deployables by 1 use

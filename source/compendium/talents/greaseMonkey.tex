\subsubsection{Grease Monkey}

\begin{talent}
{You know more than most mechanics about the inner workings of a mech. To you, the beast you pilot is more than a machine: it’s a living thing, in need of the tender care of a wise and steady hand. You maintain your own house, keep your own mech in line, both on the battlefield and o ff. Your mechanics back at base come to you for questions, but other than that they stay away: there’s something spooky about how your beast runs.}

\rank{I}{Machine Bond}
You can choose two options from the second list when you take the Stabilize action instead of 1. 
\rank{II}{Favors From Above}
Once per mission you can call in a supply drop during a rest. During a rest, you and any of your allies can replenish all your (limited) weapons and deployables by 1 and gain HP as if you had spent a repair. This HP recovery doesn’t cost repairs and you can make it even if you have 0 repairs remaining. 
\rank{III}{Hidden Stash}
You can spend 3 repairs during a rest to replenish all (limited) use weapons and deployables by 1 use

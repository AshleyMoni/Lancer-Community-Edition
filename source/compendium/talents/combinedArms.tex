\subsubsection{Combined Arms}

\begin{talent}
{True strength in combat doesn't come from mastering the blade or the gun, it comes from knowing how to use both. Through time and training, you have combined melee and ranged weapons into a single deadly combination, able to handle any threat at any range.}

\rank{III}{Storm of Violence}
Gain 1 Accuracy on the next ranged attack roll against a target if you hit that target with a melee attack, and gain 1 Accuracy on the next melee attack against a target if you hit that target with a ranged attack

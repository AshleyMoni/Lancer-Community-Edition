                                             Combined Arms  

True strength in combat doesn’t come from mastering the blade or the gun, it comes from knowing how to  

use both. Through time and training, you have combined melee and ranged weapons into a single deadly  
combination, able to handle any threat at any range.    

CQC Training (Rank I): You ignore the ranged difficulty penalty for melee engagement.
 
Blade Shield (Rank II): As long as you’re in engagement with at least 1 enemy you count as  
having light cover. This bonus extends to any allies also in engagement with you.
 
Storm of Violence (Rank III): Gain 1 Accuracy on the next ranged attack roll against a target if  
you hit that target with a melee attack, and gain 1 Accuracy on the next melee attack against a  
target if you hit that target with a ranged attack

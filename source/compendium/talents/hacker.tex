\begin{talent}
{The Omninet is everywhere, and so are you. Since you were a kid, you played the bandwidth, able to access any public node — and even a few private ones — with ease. Now, as a pilot, you dive headfirst into the hardcode of any mech core you come across. Firewalls, Gatekeeper Protocols, Invasion, Defence — nothing stands in your way. You win a fight without firing a single shot; if your enemy can't control their own mech, then they sure can't do anything to stop you.}

\rank{I}{Snow\_Crash}
When you consume Lock On as part of a tech attack, your attack deals +3 heat on hit. 
\rank{II}{Safe\_Cracker}
Gain the following options when attempting Invasion on a mech: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Jam Cockpit}: Your target cannot mount or dismount their mech until they take a full action and succeed on an engineering check to fix their cockpit.
\item \textbf{Disable Life Support}: Your target's life support is disabled. Their mech can function in a hazardous environment for a number of minutes equal to their engineering skill before consequences such as radiation or lack of air start to affect them. They can take a full action and make an engineering check with 1 difficulty to reactivate it.
\item \textbf{Hack./Slash}: Your target cannot benefit from or make Tech actions until they spend a quick action and make a successful systems check to reboot their core computer. They can also shut down their mech to gain the same effect.
\end{itemize}
\rank{III}{Last Argument of Kings}
Gain the following full tech option:\newline
\textit{Last Argument of Kings} (\textit{full tech}): Make a tech attack vs your target. On a successful attack, your target is implanted with a virus that causes their core reactor to suffer a minor meltdown. They immediately take Burn equal to their current heat.

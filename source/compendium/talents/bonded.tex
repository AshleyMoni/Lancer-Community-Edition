                                                     Bonded

The galaxy is a big place: everyone can use a friend to watch their back. Maybe you two enlisted together,

or were the only survivors of a bloody engagement. Maybe you weren’t even friends to begin with, or
maybe you were raised to fight together  -- however it came to be, when it comes time to drop, there’s no
one you’d rather have at your side. Alone, you’re deadly, but together you’re a force of nature.

I’m Your Huckleberry (Rank I): When you take this talent, choose another pilot to be your
bondmate. When you make any mech skill check while your mech is adjacent to theirs, gain +1
Accuracy. You can change your bondmate between missions, but only if something has changed
between the two of you.
Cover me! (Rank II): You can use your overwatch reaction to attack any target in your threat
range that attacks your bondmate after the attack resolves (this replaces your regular overwatch
reaction for the round).
Sundance (Rank III): Gain the following reaction:
         Intercede
         Reaction
         Once per round, when your bondmate’s mech or pilot is adjacent to you and takes
         damage from a source you can see, you can choose to take the damage instead.

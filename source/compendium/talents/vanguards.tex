Where would you rather be: in the battle line, shoulder-to-shoulder with the rest of the cannon fodder, or in
the rush, at the head of the attack, your livery clean and bright, with glory before you to win? Easy answer.
All those missiles and lances, all those hundred-kilometer-plus-need-to-adjust-for-coriolis-effect railguns,

all those kits are useless when you’re on the field. Get through their guard, get in their face, and make them
know your name.

Handshake Etiquette (Rank I): Gain +1 Accuracy on attacks with any CQB weapon at a target
within 3 range

See-Through Seeker (Rank II): You’ve modified your sensors and ammo to punch through,
disregard, or otherwise ignore cover up close. You can ignore light and heavy cover for attacks
you make with CQB weapons when your target is within 3 range of you.

Semper Vigilo (Rank III): Your overwatch attacks are now triggered by anyone entering, leaving,
or exiting your threat regardless of whether a target started their turn there.

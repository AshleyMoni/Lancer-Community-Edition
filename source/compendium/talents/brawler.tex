\subsubsection{Brawler}

\begin{talent}
{Close, personal, martial. The way battle has been done since the dawn of time, but forgotten since the first spark of gunpowder. You, however, prefer the old ways. Hand-to-hand, weapons discarded, just the strength of your machine versus the strength of theirs. You know the sweetest victory is one found at the culmination of a dance as old as war itself, in the oldest way known to humanity: by a fist to the face of your enemy.}

\rank{I}{Hold And Lock}
You gain +1 Accuracy on all melee attacks against targets you are grappling.
\rank{II}{Knockout Blow}
Gain a Brawler Die (a d6), starting at 1. Each time you make the grapple, ram, or improvised attack action, raise the value of the die by 1. When the value of the die is 6, you can spend it to make a knockout blow as an action against any adjacent target as a quick action. That target must pass a hull check with 1 difficulty or take 2d6 AP kinetic damage and become stunned until the end of its next turn. The die then resets to 1.
\rank{III}{Sledgehammer}
Your improvised attack action does 2d6 AP kinetic damage and gains knock back 2.

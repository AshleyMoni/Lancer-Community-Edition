\subsection{BASIC PILOT GEAR}
                                         BASIC PILOT GEAR
This is a list of basic pilot gear available at level 0. All gear listed here is rarity 0. More
advanced pilot gear can be found in each of the manufacturer’s sections of the compendium.
Pilots can take armor, one or two weapons, and any reasonable amount of gear with them on a
mission as long as the gear’s total rarity is less than their pilot level. All pilot weapons are `pilot'
sized.

Primitive melee weapon

This category of weapons describes weaponry made by methods pre-dating modern alloy technology, and
can describe anything from an industrial era steel sword to a stone axe. Though they are widely used in
some worlds, most of these weapons used by pilots are relics, heirlooms, or serve ceremonial purposes.

Primitive weapons are too simple to harm mechs.


Alloy/Composite weapon

This catch-all category describes melee weapons forged with advanced and non-reactive alloys and or
composite materials, allowing for durable and reliable weaponry in survival or close combat situations
where kinetic shielding reduces the effectiveness of ballistics.


Light: Knives, bayonets, arm blades, punching daggers, short swords.

Combat: Straight swords, war hammers, officer’s sabres, trench axes


Heavy: Mallets, rams, pikes, assault swords

         and text games built in.

 6       This weapon was given by or taken from someone else, willingly or otherwise.

Primitive Ranged

This weapon category describes primitive, pre-modern tech weapons such as black powder weapons,
muskets, or bows, all commonly used in some societies. Primitive weapons are too simple to harm mechs.


Signature weapon
Pilots carry a diverse array of weaponry with them into the battlefield, everything from heirloom weapons,

to custom-tooled sidearms, or anonymous military-issued assault rifles.


Choose the damage type when you acquire it (from explosive, energy, or kinetic). You can use this entry to

represent the weapon that your pilot typically carries or uses.


Sidearm: An oversized revolver, a brace of pistols, a sub-machine gun.


Combat: An assault rifle, a shotgun, a pack-fed laser, a disruption gun

Heavy: A missile tube, a heavy laser, a light machine gun, an exotic-caliber rifle

                                                     Plain Clothes

This catch-all entry describes pilots when they’re not wearing armor specifically designed for
combat. Pilots can be found sporting all kinds of fashion depending on their employment, rank,
and role - from civilian street clothing, to smart-jackets, to oil-stained overalls, to military
fatigues.





                                                         Hardsuit

There are tens of thousands of licensed hard suit makers — the Big Five notwithstanding — that an attempt
to attribute a galactic standard make and model to any one manufacturer is impossible. That said, the GMS
Model One would be the closest to a galactic standard, if one must choose.

Hardsuits are, generally speaking, any suit that provides the following protections and features: protection
from hard vacuum, protection from radiation, neural and data interface ports that interact with galactic-

standard connections, full omninet communication compatibility, some measure of kinetic and energy
protection in the form of plate armor over vital areas, some measure of environmental sealing, and some
measure of rescue capability should a pilot be forced to eject.

A pilot’s hard suit often provides an advanced interface and neurological shielding between themselves and
the mech chassis they pilot. Piloting a mech without some kind of shielding (from a suit or otherwise,

colloquially referred to as ``riding naked'') is fully possible but typically only employed by old fashioned or

daredevil pilots.

  D6     Result

  1      This hard suit was custom-tooled by an artisan manufacturer - it’s nearly one-of-a-kind, and its quality shows

  2      This hard suit is an outdated or old model but remains incredible sturdy. You might be the only one who can
         fit in it. People might have great affection for it’s model and its reputation is well deserved - though it lacks
         many features of modern suits.

  3      This hard suit is partially retractable - components of it can slide in or out of place without requiring it to be
         taken off and it can be activated by detecting pre-set micro-muscular twitches, ready to activate at a
         moment’s notice

  4      This hard suit has self-healing or sealing components, possibly biocomponents, and feeds and charges
         partly off the body’s own electromagnetism

  5      This hard suit has been heavily customized by either you or someone else, with features and notable
         cosmetic changes, such as etchings, trophies, badges or emblems

  6      This hard suit has strong cultural or background ties to your pilot, and has a signature or recognizable look -
         perhaps it is worn as part of a particular mercenary company, perhaps it is custom armor of the imperial
         guard, or perhaps it’s manufactured only on your home world

Light Hardsuit: Light hard suits are usually made of reactive, cloth like weaves, with plating and
powered components kept to a minimum to maximize mobility. Often, they resemble light body
armor or military fatigues and they may or may not have a closed helm by default, depending on
environmental expectations.





Assault Hardsuit: Standard hardsuits have heavier plating than light hardsuits, restricting
movement but providing greater protection from damage -- the heaviest versions will have vital
plating comparable to mech armor. They are often environmentally sealed and powered, and
typically have a faceplate, visor, or closed helm.

    Concussion             Gear        Grenades that detonate for a burst of concussive energy               2
    Grenades                           and a bright flash on impact. A pilot can throw a
                                       concussion grenade at any point in range 5 as an action.
                                       It detonates on impact in a blast 1 area. Make an attack
                                       roll against each target caught in the area, on hit, the
                                       target is stunned until the start of your next turn. Does not
                                       affect mechs or targets larger than human-sized.

    Corrective             Gear       This clear, plastic-sheet like medical deployable can be                1
                                       attached to severely wounded pilot, where it instantly
                                       begins stabilizing them, injecting medicine, and deploying
                                       nanites to stitch shut wounds. A corrective can be applied
                                       to any pilot that’s Down and Out to instantly bring them
                                       back to consciousness at 1/2 HP as if they had taken a
                                       rest.

   Fragmentation           Gear       A pilot can throw a frag grenade at any point in range 5 as            2
    Grenade                            an action. It detonates on impact in a blast 1 area. Make
                                       an attack roll against each target caught in the area, on
                                       hit, it deals 2 explosive damage.

   Nanite Spray            Gear       This spray paint can be sprayed on any surface. It is                   Unlimited
                                       invisible to the naked eye but can be used to transmit a
                                       simple message or limited data packets when scanned

   Patch                   Gear        `Patch' is a catch all term for sprayable medi-gel, instant-           1
                                       acting medical patches, or other first aid gear. Using a
                                       patch takes a full action and restores 1/2 your pilot’s HP
                                       (round up). It can be used on another adjacent pilot for the
                                       same effects, and although it can heal a down and out
                                       pilot, it won’t bring them back to consciousness. Has no
                                       effect on mechs.




  Stims                   Gear       These chemical stimulants are sometimes administered                   3
                                     automatically by built-in injectors in a pilot’s suit, or even
                                     their body.

                                     Choose one when you take a stim:

                                     Kick: Keeps a pilot awake and alert for up to 30 hours.

                                     Freeze: Keeps a pilot calm and emotionally stable,
                                     deadens fear or other strong reactions.

                                     Juice: Heightens senses, alertness, dispels fatigue, and
                                     shortens reaction times. Known to occasionally provoke
                                     rage in some users.


                                     Uncontrolled use of any stims can be addictive and
                                     dangerous to health in the long term and is a problem for
                                     some pilots.

  Thermal Charge          Gear       This charge can be planted on any free space for a full                1
                                     action, and detonated remotely as an action. Once
                                     detonated, it explodes in a blast 1 area. Attack all targets
                                     in the area, aim vs evasion, for 3 AP energy damage. This
                                     deals double damage to objects such as doors, walls, and
                                     automatically hits them.

Ambrosia Reservoir            Upgrade        Typically collar-mounted, an Ambrosia Reservoir carries a two-
                                             week complement of flavored or unflavored Ambrosia, a fuel-
                                             paste that can keep pilots fed and hydrated in emergency
                                             situation.

Antiphoton Visor              Upgrade        Flash/light protection, commonly found among breach teams,
                                             solar-forward operators. Effective against flash weapons, intense
                                             UV light, and incidental charge from energy weapons.

Camo Cloth                    Gear           A 5x5 square of reactive material that slowly shifts to reflect the
                                             environment around it. The effect takes about 10 seconds to
                                             complete, and makes anything hidden underneath very hard to
                                             spot.

Extra Rations                 Upgrade        Pilot rations are typically no better than their nautical antecedents
                                             - hard tack and nutritious paste. It’s not uncommon for pilots to
                                             store extra food or luxuries such as chocolate, coffee, alcohol, or
                                             canned or dried goods from their home world

Handheld Printer              Gear           A miniaturized version of the much larger Union printers, can
                                             make simple objects out of a flexible and durable plastic as long
                                             as you have the pattern chip for them.

Mag-clamps                    Upgrade        These clamps attach easily onto any metal surface, giving good
                                             maneuverability in zero-g or when repairing mechs. Can be fitted
                                             to boots.




Omnihook                      Gear           A bulky, miniaturized, portable field omninet terminal that allows
                                             for communication, data transfer, and limited hotspotting. Very
                                             valuable. Most mech teams have at least one of these, mounted
                                             or carried by a designated operator. Tuning an omnihook requires
                                             a high degree of skill.

Personal Drone                Gear           A small, non-combat drone. Fairly noisy, but can fly with good
                                             maneuverability up to half a mile without losing signal and can
                                             relay audio and visual information.

Smart Scope                   Gear           A powerful electronic scope that can give good vision up to two
                                             miles away, automatically adjusts its reticle for wind, gravity, and
                                             pressure. Can be paired with other thermal, optical, or simulated-
                                             vision devices to allow for more precise targeting. Can project its

Sleeping Bag                  Upgrade        Folds out from a hardsuit, compact enough to fit in a mech
                                             cockpit, highly resistant to changes in temperature. Some mech
                                             pilots swear by them as emergency fire protection

                                             speakers to give them a clear line to their compatriots during

                                             be equipped with a manipulator to allow for fine motor control,
                                             fitted with a weapon to allow for greater combat efficacy, or a
                                             specialty tool. It is powered, and controlled via the same
                                             neurological bridge processes that lets hardsuits respond to user
                                             input.

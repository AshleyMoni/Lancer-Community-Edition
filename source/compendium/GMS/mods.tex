                       GMS GENERAL MARKET CHASSIS MODS


Custom paint job

1 SP, Unique
This paint job counts as a system that can be destroyed by structure damage


Manipulators




Precise interaction with the built or natural environment, soft targets, and sensitive material below rated
tonnage is part of the daily routine for support-class mechs. Manipulators, haptic-padded multi-digit
“hands”, allow for such precise manipulation.

1 SP, Unique
Gain 2 extra sets of limbs. These limbs cannot be used to make attacks, but can otherwise hold
and manipulate the environment and items as normal. In addition, these manipulators can
interact with objects in the environment that a pilot would normally have to interact with (a pilot
sized touch pad, etc) with no penalty.


Personalizations

1 SP, Unique
When you take this mod, your mech gains +2 HP and you may establish with your GM 1 minor
effect or modification you have made to your mech. This mod cannot grant any statistical or
combat benefit to your mech other than the hp benefit, but could provide other useful effects. If
your GM agrees that this mod would help you with a particular skill check, they can give you +1
Accuracy on the check.


Stable Structure
1 SP, Unique

You make rolls to resist getting knocked prone with +1 Accuracy.

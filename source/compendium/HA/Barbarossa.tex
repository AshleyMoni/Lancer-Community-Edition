\subsection{HA Barbarossa}

\begin{mech}{HA}{Barbarossa}

\fluff{
The BARBAROSSA chassis is a massive frame, built to carry the heaviest of weapons and equipment. Standing nearly forty feet tall at its highest point, the BARBAROSSA is a slow, unsubtle beast of a mech, inspiring terror in enemies and comfort in allies. The weapons it can mount are capable of going toe-to-toe with corvette and cutter class ships; indeed, due to its size and slow maneuverability, the BARBAROSSA is commonly employed in micro and zero gravity engagements where mass is less of a factor. The BARBAROSSA is rated for all theaters, and excels in ranged combat situations.}

mount one = main mount,
mount two = Apocalypse Rail,
core system name = Apocalypse Rail,
core system text ={The HA Apocalypse Rail is a spinal mount augmentation that adapts the weapon mounted upon it to patch directly into its host mech’s coldcore. This allows for energy conservation/overcharge cycling: most effective with energy weapons, this system allows a pilot to dump excess offensive energy from sub-super weapons and systems into its central core, exciting the cold-burn system into an overcharge state, which is then used to overpower and override inherent limiters built into the factory spec weapon mounted in the Apocalypse Rail. This overcharge state allows for momentary overclocking of the AR-mounted weapon, sacrificing mobility and auxiliary abilities in favor of stationary defense and attack.
\textbf{Passive:} Your mech has the apocalypse rail, a weapon mount that takes a superheavy or smaller sized weapon. You can still mount smaller weapons on the apocalypse rail. You don’t need an additional mount to add a superheavy weapon to this mount. This mount is not modifiable (such as from core bonuses).},
core active name = Convert to Battery,
core active text ={\QuickAction,
Your mech converts to something more resembling a gun emplacement. While this mode is active, you have the following drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Your mech is immobilized
    \item You cannot directly attack any target within range 5 of your mech
    \item You can only make attacks with the weapon mounted in your Apocalypse Rail
\end{itemize}

However, you gain the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item You cannot be moved (such as with a grapple) by any target smaller than you
    \item You have resistance to heat
    \item The weapon mounted in your Apocalypse Rail can be fired twice with the Barrage action instead of just once. If it has the loading tag, it can still be fired twice (but must be reloaded normally after)
\end{itemize}

Instead of throwing these grenades normally, draw a line 15 spaces long from your mech. These grenades bounce over cover and objects up to size 1, and can pass through holes or areas as small as size 1/2. They detonate when they move through or adjacent to any actor’s space (even allied ones), dealing 2d6 explosive damage to that target only and knocking that actor back in the direction of the line 3 spaces. The target can pass an agility check to avoid the knock back and halve the damage.}]

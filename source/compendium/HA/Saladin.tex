\begin{mech}{HA}{Saladin}

\fluff{The Saladin chassis provides a platform for pilots to mount squad-support tier shielding. Developed in response to anti-slaver engagements in the Tian Shan ring, Harrison Armory's SALADIN chassis proved an invaluable member of Present/Persistent Danger Escort/Evac teams sent in to evacuate emancipator teams \& their charges. Records from these engagements indicate that the SALADIN's massive bulk alone was a comfort and morale boost to emancipator squads, who often referred to the chassis pattern as ``Big Sal''; SALADIN pilots from that era report null balances on bar tabs when present in emancipated systems.}

You can empower this shield, projecting it over an ally in your sensor range. As long as they remain in your sensor range, once per round, when an attack roll misses either you or the target of this shield, you can force the attacker to repeat the attack roll against a target of your choice within range (even a target allied to your attacker). This effect lasts until the end of the current scene, and you can swap your target by taking this action again.}]

The first incident was recorded when paracausal ammunition was pushed to frontline soldiers during the Tian Shen civil engagements.

There was to be no inspection of the magazines' contents, as this would ``damage the payload'' â€” frontline reports indicate that this ammunition impacts as normal on intended targets, though it seems to pierce armor and shielding at near-100\& efficacy. Samples of paracausal ammunition have been flagged by Union for retrieval, and due to its development Harrison Armory is currently undergoing investigation by the Bureau; paracausal ammunition is still in use in the field, however, as shipments continue to leak to interested parties. HORUS is suspected, and a concurrent investigation is underway.},

However, current technology is unable to lower the ambient temperature of such a surface to one low enough to not burn organic matter.},

Through numerous iterations and lifecycles, VISHNU Prime displayed a sharp ability to adapt to kinetic situations. A proclivity towards crisis management and multiple-k actor tracking led to VISHNU's pairing with the Armory's ENCLAVE shield system; by networking a series of jet-assist mobility drones carrying the ENCLAVE system, monitored and controlled by a VISHNU clone, Think Tank was able to create an unparalleled personal shielding system: the DHARMA WALL.},

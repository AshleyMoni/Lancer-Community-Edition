                                            DEMOLISHER

The prolonged siege of Jadigmora City saw the development of the DEMOLISHER patten. Based
off the long-operational berserker doctrine, DEMOLISHER tuned the chaotic heat flow to a more
sustainable, if limited system, increasing a chassis’ heavy-lift capacity to allow for supermassive
kinetic weapons to be used effectively in combat. Combined with the increased pilot shielding
and system hardening made necessary by the heat tuning, pilots soon discovered more
aggressive applications for concussion-wave ordinance.

Base systems:

Demolisher hammer
Superheavy Melee

Threat 2

AP, Knockback 2

-2 vs evasion with 1 difficulty (no difficulty at tier II, +1 Accuracy at tier III)

13/18/25 explosive damage

This weapon deals double damage against structures, objects, the environment, and cover and
gains +2 Accuracy against them.


Kinetic compensation
System

If the Demolisher misses with its hammer attack, it gains +1 Accuracy on subsequent attacks
until it hits. This effect stacks.


Optional systems:
Broad-sweep haft
Full Action

The Demolisher’s hammer can be used to make a sweep attack instead of a regular attack,
attacking all targets in threat range (allied or enemy) for +1 vs evasion/tier, 4/6/8 explosive
damage. Targets struck by this attack are impaired until the start of the Demolisher’s next turn.





Concussion missiles
Quick Action

A target in range 8 must pass an engineering check with 1 difficulty/tier or be knocked back 3
spaces and impaired until the start of the Demolisher’s next turn.


Seismic Destroyer

System, Full Action, Recharge (6+)

The Demolisher’s hammer can be used to make a special attack that hits cone 3 or line 5 from
the Demolisher instead of its regular attack. This attack cannot hit flying targets. Targets in the
area must pass a hull or agility skill check or be stunned until the end of the Demolisher’s next
turn.


Shatter module
Trait

The Demolisher’s hammer strikes against prone, immobilized, or stunned targets gain the AP tag
and can Critical Hit, dealing +1d6 bonus damage/tier on Critical Hits


Knockout Blow
Trait, Quick Action, Recharge 6+
A target adjacent to the Demolisher must pass a hull or agility check with 1 difficulty/tier or
become stunned until the end of the Demolisher’s next turn.

The Breacher can attack twice with this weapon with the attack action, choosing the same or
different targets.


BREACH Ram
Quick action, Recharge (5+)

The breacher moves forward in a straight line as far as it can, up to its speed. It ignores
engagement and obstruction (even for obstacles or mechs passed through). Obstacles or
objects such as cover are punched or smashed through and take 10 AP kinetic damage/tier. If
the obstacle is an especially hardy composition (such as a starship hull) the breacher can make a
successful hull check to smash through instead. All other targets passed through must pass a
hull check with 1 difficulty or be knocked out of the breacher’s path and knocked prone.


Optional Systems:

Unload
Full Action

The breacher chooses a target in range of its dual shotguns. At the start of the breacher’s next
turn, if the target is still in range, the breacher can attack that target with its dual shotguns with
+3 Accuracy (for a total of +2 Accuracy by default) as a free action.

Quick Tech

+1 vs e-defense/tier with +1 Accuracy

The Breacher chooses a target in sensor range and makes a tech attack. On hit, all its attacks
gain +1 accuracy/tier against that target, and 1/turn it can take the boost action as a Free Action,
as long as it is made directly towards that target. The Breacher cannot change its target until it or
the target is destroyed.

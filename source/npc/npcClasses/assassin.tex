\subsection{Assassin}
\begin{npc}{Assassin}

\fluff{Assassin style mechs trend towards agility, damage, and speed. Their pilots sacrifice comfort for a chassis

efficiency â€” unnecessary life-support systems, pilot care systems, communications systems, and others
are stripped out and replaced with systems that increase processing power, run-silent ability, and increase
chassis range.

Assassin pilots work alone or in small groups, piloting their small, sleek mechs into territory thought
impenetrable by their targets. One of the few doctrines to employ bladed weapons, assassin-style pilots

train both in the cockpit and out of it to be able to fight with any weapon, in any theater, as efficiently as
possible.}

be removed during a rest or by taking a quick action and successfully repeating this check.}]

\subsection{Ultra}
                                                   ULTRA

In Lancer, Ultra-type enemies are typically the most dangerous individual enemies a party can
face.

Ultra-type enemies are high-tier enemies that do not usually fill command roles. Ultras are
champions, favored warriors, major domos: they might command a few units in a retinue or lead
armies from the front, but they do not typically engage in grand strategy.

Making an Ultra

All ultras get the following features added to their base NPC type:

    -    Bonus activations: The Ultra can be activated again (take another turn) each round. If
        the Ultra is facing more than 4 players, it takes another activation (for a total of 3). It
         regains spent reactions each time it takes a turn.
    -    Deadly: The Ultra can Critical Hit, dealing an extra +2 bonus damage/tier on Critical Hits.

    -    Exclusive templates: The Ultra can’t take the Elite or Grunt templates.
    -   Juggernaut (trait): At the start of its turn, the Ultra ends one condition affecting it. If it
         rolls a ‘system destroyed’ result on a structure check, it is instead jammed until the end of
         its next turn (it doesn’t lose the system or weapon).

    -    Legendary (trait): The Ultra can enter the CRITICAL state and is not destroyed when
         reaching 0 HP.
    -   Structure: The Ultra gains 4 Structure, or increases its structure up to 4 structure if it
         already has structure

    -   Stress: The Ultra gains 4 reactor stress, or increases its stress up to 4 if it already has
        stress.
    -    Bonus module: The ultra should gain +1-2 more optional modules than normal.
    -    Bonus HP: The Ultra gains +5 HP
    -    Reflex (trait): The Ultra can make any number of overwatch attacks per round (instead of
        just 1). It can only attack the same target 1/turn with overwatch.

Then choose 1-3 Ultra Traits or modules.

until the end of their next turn.


Obliterator

Action, Ordnance, Recharge (6+)

Choose a direction, then draw a line 30 spaces long and 2 spaces wide in that direction. Each
target inside that area must pass an agility skill check or take 1/2 of its current hit points in energy
damage, or 1/4 on a successful check, rounded up. Any cover, objects, buildings, drones,
deployables, or items smaller than size 5 in the area are completely annihilated.

that is in range and not in cover or prone as a Free Action. It can fire the same weapon multiple
times for this special action, ignoring the loading tag during this attack.


WOLFHOUND missile
Heavy Launcher

Recharge (6+)

Instead of firing this weapon normally, choose a target within range 30. The ultra fires a
wolfhound missile at the target, which is size 1, moves speed 4, has evasion 10, 0 armor, and
10/15/20 HP. The missile primes in an adjacent space when deployed, then moves 3 at the start
of each the ultra’s turns. If its target suffers from the Locked On condition, its movement
increases to 6. The missile can benefit from cover and can be targeted and shot by systems and
weapons. It must move towards its target, but can maneuver skillfully around cover, fit through




holes, etc. If the missile’s movement causes it to collide with a hostile mech or its target, it
detonates for a blast 1 explosion. Mechs caught inside must pass an agility skill check or take
15/20/30 energy damage, and half on a successful check.


The Ultra can have only one missile fired at a time. Only check for recharge if this missile has hit
its target or been destroyed.

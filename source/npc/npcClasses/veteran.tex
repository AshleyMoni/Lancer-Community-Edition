\subsection{Veteran}
                                                   VETERAN

Veteran-type enemies are hardened, experienced fighters that have survived direct engagement
with their foes. Their encounter with your players is not their first rodeo: their ability to withstand
morale shocks is far higher than an untested greenhorn.


Making a Veteran:

All Veterans get the following features added to their base NPC type:

     -   Bonus structure: The veteran gains +1 structure.

     -   Bonus stress: The Veteran gains +1 reactor stress
     -   Veterancy: The Veteran gains +1 accuracy on all checks of one statistic: Hull, Agility,
         Systems, Engineering (choose on creation)

Then choose up to 1 Veteran trait per tier:
AI co-pilot
Trait
The veteran's mech or vehicle gains the AI tag. The veteran's mech or vehicle is autonomous and
can function even if the veteran is not piloting it (per the player rules). The AI can be unshackled,
with the same effects as player AI.


Acrobat
Trait
When the veteran moves or boosts, it can fly 3 after the move or boost completes. This flight
does not provoke reactions and ignores engagement.


Deadly
Trait
This mech can Critical Hit, dealing +2 bonus damage/tier to its attacks on crit.


EM-shielding
Trait
The veteran is resistant to heat


Engineer
Trait, Quick Action
The Veteran can take the repair quick action:

         Repair (limited 1): This mech heals 4 hit points per tier and ends one condition currently
         affecting it (impaired, Slowed, immobilized, shut down, jammed)


Feign Death
Trait




The first time in a challenge this enemy would be destroyed, though it appears destroyed, it is
instead shut down, remaining at 1 hp. A successful scan or pilot notice check will reveal it is still
active.


Hacker
Trait
The veteran's invasion attacks deal +3 heat


Headshot
Trait
1/round when the veteran scores a Critical Hit, the target of its attack must pass an engineering
check or be jammed until the start of the veteran's next turn.


Hardened Target
Trait
Invasion, scan, and lock on attempts on this target are made with +1 difficulty


Legendary
Trait
The veteran can enter the CRITICAL state (like the player) instead of being destroyed when
ticking off its last structure point.


Lesser Sight
Trait

Within range 3 of the Veteran, targets cannot hide from it, and cannot benefit from invisibility
against it while inside that area.


Limitless
Trait

The veteran can use Overcharge


Lightning Reflexes
Trait
Reaction

The first time in a round the veteran is targeted by any weapon system of size heavy or larger, roll
a d6. On a 5+, the weapon automatically misses this mech.


Parting Gift
Trait
The veteran can use the Self Destruct action.


Rodeo master
Trait




The veteran can jockey (in a hard suit) and gains +1 Accuracy on jockeying attempts


Shock Armor

The veteran has resistance to damage from main size weapons


Skirmisher
Trait

1/round the veteran can move or boost as a reaction to any enemy movement or action that it
can see.


Slippery

Trait

The veteran does not provoke reactions and ignores engagement with its move (its boost still
provoke reactions)


Steel Jaw
Trait
The most damage an auxiliary weapon can do to the veteran is 1.


Viper's Speed
Trait
The veteran always takes its turn first, even over player characters. If there is a question of who
acts first (in the story, or combat), it is always the veteran.

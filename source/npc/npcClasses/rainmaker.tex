                                             RAINMAKER

The tongue-in-cheek designation describes a combat doctrine that patterns chassis around the
optimal use of rockets and missiles in combat. Favored by all-theater combat units, Rainmakers
are mobile platforms loaded with ordinance, able to handle engagements at any range, against
any target.

8/11/14 explosive damage


Optional systems:
HADES missile

Quick Action, Recharge (5+)

The rainmaker targets a cone 3 area drawn in any direction from a point within range 20 of its
location. This system tracks line of sight as if it were an arcing weapon. All targets in that area
must pass an agility check or take 3/5/7 energy damage and 2/4/6 heat, and half on a successful
check.





Rigged payload
System

When the rainmaker is destroyed, it explodes in a burst 2 explosion centered on itself. Targets
caught within must pass an agility check or take 8/12/16 explosive damage, and half on a
successful check.


Volley
System, Full Action, Recharge (5+)

All hostile targets within range 30 of the rainmaker must pass an agility check or take 4/6/8
explosive damage, or half on a successful check. This system tracks line of sight as if it was a
seeking weapon.


Huntsman
Trait

While firing at a target suffering from the Lock On condition, the rainmaker's weapons gain the
Smart and Seeking tags.


Atlas missile
Superheavy launcher

Ordnance, Arcing

Range 30

This weapon system replaces the Drang Missile rack. Instead of targeting a mech, the rainmaker
instead targets a space on the ground within range. The targeted area is visible to all in line of
sight. At the start of its next turn, the missile lands, targeting a burst 2 area centered on that
space. All targets caught within must pass an agility check or take 15/20/25 explosive damage,
and half on a successful check.

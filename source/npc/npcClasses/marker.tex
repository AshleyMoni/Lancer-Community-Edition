                                                MARKER

Marker doctrine calls for the active, close, and aggressive application of orbital, atmospheric, and
terrestrial fire support on identified and potential enemy positions. Equipped with more-than-
cursory targeting systems, Marker doctrine pilots adopt an tactical/artillery commander role,
operating on the ground with infantry, chassis, and other vehicles to build a map of the
battlescape in order to more accurately place small arms fire, bombs, shells, missiles, beams, and
kinetic kill clouds. They are not usually a threat in face-to-face combat, but the threat they
represent to a combat cannot be underestimated.

+1 vs e-defense/tier with 1 Accuracy

Range 20

Targets hit by this attack immediately gain Lock On and are Shredded while they suffer from
Lock On. They then cannot turn invisible or benefit from invisibility, and cannot hide until the end
of the Marker’s next turn. If the Marker is destroyed or this weapon is disabled, immediately end
this condition.


Optional systems:




Orbital Strike
System, recharge 5+

Instead of firing the target marker at an enemy, the Marker can fire it at a point within range 30.
At the start of the Marker’s next turn, that area is hit by an orbital strike. Any mechs still in a burst
3 area centered on that point must pass an agility check or take 12/17/22 energy damage and be
knocked prone, or half and no prone on a successful check.


HOUND missile

Quick Action, Recharge (6+)

Choose a target within range 20. The marker fires a hound missile at the target, which is size 1/2,
has evasion 10, and 10/15/20 HP. The missile primes on the turn that it is fired, deploying in an
adjacent space, then moves 3 at the start of each of the marker’s turns. If its target suffers from
the Lock On condition, its movement increases to 6. The missile can benefit from cover, counts
as flying with hover flight, and can be targeted and shot by systems and weapons. It must move
towards its target, but can maneuver skillfully around cover, fit through holes, etc. If the missile’s
movement causes it to collide with a hostile mech or its target, it detonates for a blast 1
explosion. Mechs caught inside must pass an agility skill check or take 15/20/25 energy damage
and half on a successful check.


Blind
Quick Tech, Recharge (4+)

+2 vs e-defense with +1 Accuracy/tier

On hit, the target only has line of sight to adjacent squares until the end of its next turn.


Rebound Scan
System, Full Action

All targets in range 10 of the marker must pass a systems check or immediately lose the benefit
of all cover, hiding, and invisibility and be unable to take cover, hide, or turn invisible until the
start of the Marker’s next turn.


Smart Missile Cloud
System

At the start of the marker’s turn, one target suffering from Lock On in the Marker’s sensor range
takes 4/5/6 explosive damage from the Marker, no roll required.

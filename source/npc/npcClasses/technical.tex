                                              TECHNICAL

Technicals lean into the incredible tumult of systemic warfare, operating both in realtime and
among the omnicloud tempest that descends upon a combat theater. Technicals often pair with
personality-clone NHPs — NHPs that structure profiles based on profiles of their pilots — to
handle the chaotic swirl that results from realtime/omninet combat splitting.

HORUS hacker
Trait

This mech makes tech actions with +1 Accuracy and its invasions deal +1/2/3 heat on hit.


Snap Fire
Trait, Quick Action

This mech makes one autogun attack

Predatory logic

Quick Tech, Recharge (5+)

+2 vs e-defense/tier with +1 Accuracy





On hit, the target immediately makes an attack with a single weapon of the technical’s choice
against any other target within range (even an allied target).


Puppet system
Quick Tech

+2 vs e-defense/tier

On hit, the target is impaired until the end of its next turn. In addition, the technical can
immediately cause that target to move up to its speed in a direction of the technical’s choice.


SCORPION protocols
System

The technical gains the hardened target trait (invasion, lock on, and scan are made at +1
difficulty). In addition, any failed invasion, lock on, or scan attempt on it inflicts 2/3/4 heat to the
attacker.


Illusory subroutines
Quick Tech

+2 vs e-defense/tier

On hit, all actors allied to the Technical count as invisible to the target until the start of its next
turn.


System link
System, Quick Action

The Technical links systems with an allied mech within its sensor range. It can only link with one
mech at a time. While linked, the allied mech gains +1 Accuracy/tier, and the allied mech can use
the Technical’s systems score for all checks it makes. However, if either linked mech becomes
jammed or impaired, the other also suffers the same condition for the same duration as long as
the link persists. The link is disabled if either mech is destroyed or this system is disabled or
destroyed.

                                               INFANTRY

Infantry-type enemies represent a squad-level group of human or subaltern infantry: not a single
chassis like the Grunt-type, but (generally) a group of five to ten armed and armored individual
soldiers. Like the Grunt, an Infantry-type enemy alone might not present a threat to a chassis, but
operating as a squad with the right gear and training, infantry groups are a formidable threat.

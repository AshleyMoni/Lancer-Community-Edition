                                                  RONIN

Ronin doctrine chassis differ from Berserker and DEMOLISHER pattern chassis in that they have
been purpose-built by boutique fabricators to excel in melee combat. Ronin patterns are
common among martial cultures and event-combat firms both. Tactical applications for Ronin
chassis are difficult in cultures where ranged weapons are preferred, but there is a certain
prestige earned by pilots who adopt ancient weapons in the modern day and survive. That being
said the availability of stasis and mag based defensive technology has made the Ronin doctrine
marginally more viable in modern combat.

Base systems:
Carbon Fiber Sword
Main Melee

+2 vs evasion with 1 Accuracy/tier

Threat 1

6 kinetic damage

This weapon can attack once per tier (up to 3 times at tier 3) with the attack action

This weapon can Critical Hit, and deals an extra +1d6 kinetic damage on Critical Hit


Mag Parry
System, Shield, Reaction

Once per round, when damaged by a ranged weapon, the Ronin can roll a d6. On a roll of a 5+,
the Ronin gains resistance to all the damage from that attack, and the target must repeat the
attack roll against itself, dealing damage on a success.


Optional systems:
Charged Slash
Full Action, recharge (5+)





All targets adjacent to the Ronin must make a successful agility check or take 8/12/16 kinetic
damage, and half on a successful check.


Reflex Implant
System

When the Ronin boosts, attackers gain +2 Difficulty to attack it until the start of the Ronin's next
turn.


Echo Edge
System

When the Ronin damages a target, it marks that target (keep track of it). At the start of its turn,
the Ronin can consume all these marks as a free action to deal 1d6 AP kinetic damage to all
targets, no attack roll required. They last until consumed, until the Ronin is destroyed, or until the
end of the current challenge.


Hyper-reflex mode
System, Quick Action, Recharge (5+)

This system remains active until the end of the Ronin's next turn. While active, the first time each
turn (the Ronin's turn or any other actor's turn) the Ronin is targeted by an attack, it can
immediately make a Carbon Fiber Sword attack against a target in range before the attack is
made.


Extended Blade
The Ronin's Carbon Fiber Sword becomes threat 2. The first time it critically hits with a melee
attack on a turn, all targets within its threat take 3/4/5 kinetic damage including the target of its
attack.

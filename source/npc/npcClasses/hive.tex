                                                   HIVE

A recent development following the Deimos Contact Event, Hive doctrine chassis are, in theory,
not too different than their pre-Contact cousins: they establish a local, secure omninetwork,
fabricate and deploy a century or half-century of drones, and coordinate them in achieving their
mission. The difference between pre-Contact and post-Contact drone controllers is ease: pilots
who pursue this doctrine establish complex handler-trainer relationships with their hives, allowing
them to segue between direct control and autonomous operation unimpeded by tactile interface.
Hive pilots exhibit signs of psychological trauma at one month continuous drone-strain operation,
and it is recommended that they practice a strict two-week format cycling with their paired hive.

making a tech attack. On hit, the target takes Burn 4/6/8. The Hive can only have one target
attacked by these drones at once.


Razor Swarm

The Hive creates a blast 2 area within sensor range. The area remains until the end of combat or
the Hive is destroyed. Targets allied to the hive can use the area for light cover. Otherwise, any
target that starts its turn in the area or moves into it for the first time on its turn takes 3 Burn/tier.
The Hive can deploy any number of Razor Swarms.


Swarm Shield

The Hive releases a cloud of miniature drones that cluster around it, providing heavy protection.
The Hive has resistance to damage from the next 1d6 attacks.

\subsection{Commander}
                                              COMMANDER

Commander-type enemies operate on a grand scale, controlling fleets and armies across worlds
and in interstellar space. They might not be the best individual combatant, but they can bring out
the best in the best of their forces.

Making a Commander:

All Commanders get the following features added to their base NPC type:

    -    Bonus structure: The Commander gains +1 structure
    -    Bonus stress: The Commander gains +1 reactor stress
    -    Command: Once per round, the Commander can cause an allied target it can see to re-
         roll any single attack roll or check as a reaction. The commander can't use this reaction if
         it is Jammed.
    -    Commander Traits: The commander can choose one of the following commander traits.
         These traits don't function if the commander is Jammed.

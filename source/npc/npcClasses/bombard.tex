                                             BOMBARD

The Bombard doctrine calls for unending salvos of punishing artillery bombardments. Chassis
tuned to this style of combat are found miles behind the line in fortified positions, or otherwise
removed from combat: one common strategy for prolonged area-denial bombardment is to place
a battery of bombard chassis on a world's local moon(s). From that movable satellite, the battery
can rain FRAMEs down upon the world below, well removed from the dangers of combat.

+2 vs evasion/tier with 1 difficulty

Range 20, Blast 2

10/14/18 kinetic damage


Stabilizers
System, Full Action

As a full action, this mech can engage or disengage its stabilizers. While they are active, the
mech cannot move or be knocked prone, but it gains +1 accuracy and +10 range on its attacks
and cannot fire any weapons at a target within range 5 of itself. If this system is destroyed, the
mech is immobilized.


Molded Armor
System

The Bombard has resistance to explosive damage


Optional systems:
H.A. Siege Shield




System, Shield, Passive

The mech has resistance to all damage that it takes from attacks further away than range 5.


High-Impact shells
Trait

The Bombard cannon gains knock back 3


LMG

Main Cannon

One or two targets

Range 10

+1 vs evasion/tier

4/6/8 kinetic damage


Cluster-seeker Bombs
System

After the artillery fires its bombard cannon, 3 additional targets within range 10 of the primary
target take 2 explosive damage/tier (no check or roll required).


Devastator Protocol
Trait, Full Action, recharge (6+)

Choose 1d3 points within range of the mech, and mark them (so they are clearly visible to all
players). The bombard must be activated last next round. At the start of its next turn, the mech
fires at each of those points with its bombard cannon, as a free action, attacking all targets and
structures within. It cannot choose these points so that the blast area from these attacks overlap
in any way.

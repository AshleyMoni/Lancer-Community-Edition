                                              SENTINEL

Sentinel doctrine chassis fill guard roles. Typically found in the retinues of commanders or posted
in defense of batteries, Sentinel chassis employ a suite of technology that ensures their charges
stay alive and operational, even if it means the Sentinel's death.

Eye of Midnight

System, Quick Action

This system can be activated or deactivated as a quick action, and remains indefinitely. While
this system is active, the Sentinel is Slowed, but is not limited in the number of overwatch
reactions it can make per round.


Optional systems:

Punisher Ammunition




System

The first enemy damaged by the Sentinel's combat shotgun each round must pass a engineering
heck with 1 difficulty or be Slowed until the end of the sentinel's next turn.


Wrath-lock
System, Full Action

The sentinel may arm this module as a full action. While armed, the next time it fires its combat
shotgun, it makes 3 attacks instead of one.


Impaler
System

The first enemy damaged by an overwatch shot from the Sentinel must pass an agility check
with 1 difficulty or immediately stop moving and become immobilized until the end of the
sentinel's next turn.


Watchful
Trait

Once per round, in response to any enemy movement, the Sentinel can make the boost action as
a reaction.


Guardian protocols

Trait

At the start of its turn, the Sentinel can nominate an allied mech within range 5. Once per turn
(but any number of times per round) when that mech is targeted by an attack, the Sentinel can
immediately make a single attack for free against the attacker if it is in range as a reaction.

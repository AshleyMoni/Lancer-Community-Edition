                                                    SHIP

Ship-type enemies are any military or civilian vehicles that are flight capable and operate primarily
in space, outside the bounds of atmosphere (though many can operate in-atmos if need be).


Making a Ship

You can use any of the mech classes and apply this template to convert that mech into a ship.
They lose the mech tag and gain the vehicle tag. All ships get the following features added to
their base NPC type:

    -    Flier: A ship always counts as having an EVA module in space. In atmosphere, it can fly
        with either normal flight or hover flight (depending on type). If a ship is grounded without
         landing, it is immobilized. If it is immobilized, knocked prone, or stunned mid-air, it
        crashes.
    -    Massive size: A ship is typically much larger than a mech. If its size is less than 4,
         increase its size to 4. This template describes ships that can be engaged on a ship-to-
         mech level about up to size 6-8. Much larger ships (size 10/20+) are usually too heavily
        armored for mech-mounted weapons to harm
    -   Crew: A ship might be operated by more than one crew member (typically a minimum
         number of crew equal to 1/2 of the vehicle’s size). As long at least half the crew is alive, the
        ship can still function.

    -    Bonus HP: Increase the Ship’s HP by +5
    -    No manipulators: A ship cannot initiate a grapple, pick up, or manipulate items
    -    Limited melee attacks: A ship cannot make melee attacks other than Ram





-   Transport: A transport ship can hold one squad or a number of entities whose total size
    (added together) is less than its size

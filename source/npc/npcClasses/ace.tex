\subsection{Ace}
                                                  ACE

A pilot more comfortable the closer they get to their roots, the Ace enemy-type employs high-speed

strafing runs, agile maneuvers, and a reckless approach to piloting their mech. Cocky and self-assured,
Ace-type enemies relish a good duel.

Optional systems:
Bombing Bay
System, Limited (6)

1/turn

When the mech flies while it moves or boosts, it can drop a bomb on one target below as a free
action it that it passes over or adjacent to. Bombs create a blast 1 area with at least 1 square on
their target. All affected targets must pass an agility check or take 6/9/12 explosive damage and
be knocked prone.





Strafing Module
System, Quick Action

1/round

The mech flies its speed in any direction in a strafing run, dealing 3/5/7 kinetic damage to any
enemy it passes over or adjacent to (no roll required).


Burst/Dash module
System

Recharge (5+)

The mech may activate this module instead of moving normally, engaging powerful thrusters. It
flies its speed in a straight line in any direction. This movement doesn’t provoke reactions,
ignores, engagement, and any mechs engaged with the target when it activates this module
must pass an agility check or be knocked prone.


Chaff Launchers
System, Reaction

Recharge (6+)

In response to any hostile tech action or attack, the mech launches chaff and engages digital
scramblers, causing the attack to miss, and granting it immunity to tech attacks and ranged or
melee attacks with the smart keyword until the end of its next turn.


Attitude Thrusters
System, Reaction

1/round, Recharge (5+)

In response to being hit by any ranged attack, the mech does a barrel roll, flying 3 in any
direction and gaining resistance to all the damage of that attack.

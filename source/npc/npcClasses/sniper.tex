                                                 SNIPER

Sniper pattern chassis are common throughout the galaxy’s armies. Favoring stability and
targeting over mobility, Snipers operate extremely long-ranged kinetic weapons in small, self-
sufficient teams well removed from any direct combat. Sniper pilots are a proud breed, who
emphasize economy and elegance over destructive power. Their weapons are often as tuned and
modified as much as their chassis are; the pilots themselves often exhibit unparalleled control
over their targeting systems. Partnered NHPs are said to send boast-data between themselves,
noting the difficulty of landed shots to allied pilots.

Deathmark protocol
System, Full Action

The Sniper marks a target within range 20. While marked, the Sniper’s anti material rifle attacks
against that target causes it to take 1 structure damage on hit instead of dealing damage
normally (causing the target to make a structure check and reset its HP). The Sniper can only
have one mark active at a time, but can transfer it if need be. The target can avoid this effect if it




is in any kind of cover, or if it’s prone (it is aware of this effect), and instead takes damage
normally.


Optional systems:

Defensive Grapple
System, Quick Action, Reaction, Recharge (4+)

The Sniper chooses a point within range 5 (vertical or horizontal) and pulls itself to that point with
a grappling hook as if it had flown. It can use this as an action on its turn or a reaction to an
enemy’s movement that it can see.


Climber
Trait

The sniper can climb any surface with no penalty and walk or stand on such surfaces as if they
were flat ground, even overhanging or vertical surfaces.


Selective Loader
System

The Sniper can fire one of several types of ammunition, choosing one before it attacks:

	        Impact: Targets hit by the AM rifle must pass a hull check or be knocked prone

         EMP: Targets hit by the AM rifle must pass a system check or be Jammed until the end of
         their next turn

         Flare: Targets hit by the AM rifle cannot hide or turn invisible until the end of their next
         turn

         Molten: Targets hit by the AM rifle must pass an engineering check or become Shredded
         until the end of their next turn.


Over-penetrating Round
System, protocol, recharge (6+)

The Sniper loads an over-penetrating round into its anti-material rifle. Its next attack with the rifle
becomes Line 30.


Flash Bomb
System, Quick action, recharge (6+)

The sniper fires a bomb at a blast 2 area within range 5 of it. Targets other than the Sniper caught
inside must pass a systems check or become Slowed and jammed until the end of their next
turn. The area counts as light cover until the start of the sniper’s next turn

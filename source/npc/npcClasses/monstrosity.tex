                                           MONSTROSITY

Monstrosity-type enemies are massive or horrifying predatory wildlife. Generally wild, some kinds
of monstrous enemies can be domesticated and trained for combat: these are in high demand in
the distal and proximal reaches of the galaxy.

The monstrosity can burrow into the ground as a quick action, as long as the ground beneath it
is malleable enough. While burrowed, it counts as invisible, ignores all obstructions above

can boost and take reactions while grappling.

counts all terrain as being large enough to hide it (no matter the size difference).

                                       TEMPLATES


These templates can be applied to any of the above enemy types to add more flavor or change
the way they function in combat. In particular, the Ultra, Elite, Grunt, and Veteran templates can
be used to make tougher or easier enemies. The Veteran template can be applied on top of the
Ultra or Elite templates to make an especially tough enemy.

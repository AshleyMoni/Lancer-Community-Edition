                                              OPERATOR

Operator doctrine chassis are a known-unknown. Operators typically field smaller chassis not
commonly encountered on the front lines; do not mistake this for fragility. Pilots who are recruited
and trained into this doctrine, regardless of culture, are dangerous, deadly, the best of their
state’s armed forces or martial tradition. They operate alone or in small teams under the auspices
of black-site state agencies, engaging in the most sensitive and dangerous AMNESIAC-tier
missions. Their chassis — and their bodies — are loaded with some of the most advanced tech
available; if they die in combat, it is not uncommon for their bodies and their chassis to self-
immolate, rendering what technology and data they had into waste and ash.

Base systems:

‘Raptor’ plasma rifle
Heavy Rifle

+2 vs evasion/tier

Range 15

8 energy damage

This weapon can attack twice at tier III with the attack action


‘Nightcloak’ type omnishield
System, Shield

While this system is active, the operative has resistance to one of the following types of damage:
kinetic, explosive, energy, heat. The operative must decide which when it starts combat (setting it
is a Free Action) and cannot change it during combat.


Self-erasing
Trait

When this mech is destroyed, it immediately self-immolates into superheated plasma. All targets
adjacent to it when it is destroyed must pass an agility check or take 4/6/8 energy damage or




half on a successful check. This mech is then removed from the battlefield - it is utterly
annihilated.


Optional systems:
Fade generator
System

While this system is intact, at the end of its turn, the Operative becomes invisible until the start of
its next turn. This effect is immediately disabled if the Operative takes damage until the start of
the Operator’s next turn.


Refractive shield
System, Shield

This system is permanently disabled if the operative overheats. While it is active, the operative
gains the Hardened Target trait (scans, lock on attempts, and invasions against it are made at +1
difficulty).


Skirmisher implant
System

Once at any point on its turn, the operative can make a boost action as a free action.


Nova missile
Auxiliary Launcher

Smart, Seeking

+1 vs e-defense with 1 Accuracy/tier

Range 30, blast 1

4/6/8 energy damage


Trace Drive
System

Once on its turn, when the Operative moves or boosts, it instead teleports up to 8 spaces away,
as long as its target destination is a free space. This movement does not provoke reactions and
ignores engagement, such as overwatch.

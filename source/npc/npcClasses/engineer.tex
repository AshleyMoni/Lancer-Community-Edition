                                              ENGINEER

Engineer doctrine chassis are common throughout the galaxy, their patterns unique to the world
or theater in which they operate, but their charge the same: defend, maintain, secure. Engineers
operate best in the mid to rear of the line, coordinating the defense of important positions and
ensuring total operational deployment of all mission assets. Remember: if your chassis can't
make it to the line, you lose.

+1 vs e-defense/tier

Range 15

5/7/9 kinetic damage

This weapon gains +1 Accuracy against flying targets. Flying targets damaged by this weapon
must pass an agility check or fall.


Deployable turret
System, Drone, Quick Action, Recharge (4+)

The engineer deploys a self-building turret in an adjacent, open space. The turret is an immobile
size 1 drone with simple AI that attacks the nearest hostile target. It has evasion 10, 10 HP, and 1
armor. It attacks on the Engineer's turn for +1/tier vs evasion, range 10, 2/3/4 kinetic damage,
but can take no other actions.


Ablative Shielding

System

The Engineer has resistance to energy damage





Optional systems:
Power deployer
System

The Engineer can deploy two turrets when it uses its deployable turret system


Arsenal
The Engineer can deploy stronger turrets, and three different types of turrets, and can choose
which to deploy when it uses its system. Each have the same statistics as a base turret, with the
following changes:

         Inferno: The turret's weapon becomes +1/tier vs evasion, cone 5, Burn 3/4/5

         Hellstorm: The turret's weapon becomes +1/tier vs evasion, range 15, blast 1, 2/3/4
         explosive damage

         Hunter: The turret's weapon gains the smart tag

         Primed: When the turret or the engineer is destroyed, it explodes in a burst 1 area around
         it. Targets caught inside must pass an agility check or take 7/9/11 explosive damage


Skyshield protocol
System

The Engineer's deployable turrets gain +1 accuracy against flying targets.


Point Defense Drone
System, Drone, Quick Action, Recharge (5+)

The engineer deploys a drone in an adjacent space which creates a burst 1 zone around it. The
engineer can only deploy one drone at a time. While inside this zone, targets allied to the
engineer are immune to weapons with the Seeking and Smart tags. The drone can be attacked
and destroyed, though it benefits from its own zone.


Tracking Computer
System, Reaction

Once per round, the Engineer's Flak Cannon can be fired once as a reaction to any boost action
or movement outside of regular movement by a hostile mech it can see.

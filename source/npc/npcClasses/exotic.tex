\subsection{Exotic}
                                                      EXOTIC

Exotic-type enemies are, even for a galaxy of wonders, strange and dangerous enemies. Some
feature unique technologies not yet available to the wider galaxy, others wield primitive weapon
styles updated to the modern day, and others carry equipment or adopt tactics that are alien to
Union doctrine.


Making an Exotic NPC:

All Exotic NPCs get the following features added to their base NPC type:

     -   Xenotech: Scans reveal no information about exotic modules
     -   Hardened Target: Hostile tech actions take +1 difficulty against exotic targets
     -   Exotic systems: Any NPC with the exotic tag can choose one or two of the optional
         exotic modules below

Exotic modules

Bio-integrated
Trait

You may only choose this trait for a mech. The mech gains the biological tag (it loses heat
capacity and cannot take or be the target of tech actions except Lock On and scans).





Blinkspace Carver
System

When the NPC moves, it teleports.


Extrusion
Trait

The NPC is only a partial extrusion of a higher-concept entity and only partially present in
physical space. It gains resistance to all damage but all its weapons also deal half damage and it
can be passed through as if it wasn’t there (it doesn’t provide obstruction).


Living Weaponry
Trait

The NPC becomes immune to the Jammed condition. Its weapons have biotechnical and semi-
organic components that spontaneously generate ammunition.


Paracausal Weapon
Trait

Choose one of the NPC’s weapons. Damage from that weapon cannot be reduced in any way
(by armor, resistance, or otherwise)


Ouroboros Brand
System

1/round the NPC can force a re-roll by themselves or any allied or hostile target (but must choose
the second result) by causing localized distortions in the flow of time.


Regenerator
Trait

The NPC heals 2/3/4 HP at the end of its turn. This trait does not function if the NPC took energy
damage at any point during the round.

    TALENTS  

In LANCER, talents represent a pilot’s knowledge, experience, veterancy, and abilities. Talents  
require talent points to gain or deepen; talent points are gained when you create your pilot, and  
when your pilot levels up. When spending a talent point, a pilot can choose to broaden their  
knowledge by acquiring a new rank I talent, or they can choose to deepen their knowledge of a  
talent they already possess by acquiring higher ranks.
 

At level 0, a pilot gains three talent points to spend on talents. Spending a talent point acquires a  
talent at rank I, or increases the rank of the talent by I. You need the previous rank of a talent to  
take the next one. At level 0, a pilot cannot deepen any talents past Rank I. Each time a pilot  
levels up, they gain 1 talent point to acquire a new talent or deepen an existing talent to the next  
rank.
 

                                                MECH ONLY  
Talents only apply to your mech’s systems and weapons unless specified
 

                                               NEXT ATTACK  
Some talents and systems activate on ‘next attack roll’  - this means the very next single 1d20  
attack roll you make, not the entire skirmish or barrage attack action, for example.

                                                    DRONE   

Drone-type enemies are mechs or subaltern frames that are autonomous extensions of  
companion/concierge units or combat NHPs.  

Making an Drone
 
All Drones get the following features added to their base NPC type:
 
    -    Bonus HP: The Drone gets +5 HP to represent its lack of pilot. It can take damage that  
         would normally blow through a cockpit and kill a human.  
    -    No Pilot: The Drone permanently suffers from the Impaired condition. It cannot make  
         complex decisions or moral judgements. However, it is also immune to all systems and  
         actions that affect the pilot (it doesnâ€™t have any).  

                                                                                                                


     -   Vulnerable to Tech: All hostile tech actions against the Drone can be made with +1  
         Accuracy

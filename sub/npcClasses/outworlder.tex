                                            OUTWORLDER   

Outworlder-type enemies are found in the distal/proximal areas of the galaxy. They are, typically,  
more rugged and independent than other enemy types, able to operate on a shoestring -- or  
without one! -- for extended periods of time.  
 

Making an Outworlder
 

    -    Resourceful: The Outworlder gains +1 use to all (limited) use weapons, actions, and  
        deployables (including the repair action below - not yet included in the profile).  
    -   The outworlder gains the repair action:  
             -   Repair (limited 1): This mech heals 4/6/8 hit points and ends one condition  
                 currently affecting it (impaired, Slowed, immobilized, shut down, jammed)

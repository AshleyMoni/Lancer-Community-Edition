GMS weapons, much like their premier mech line, are reliable, galactic standards, made from  
interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions imaginable.
 

The Type I line includes powerful and reliable weapons that rely on conventional ammunition  
methods, such as the MC-AR, P, BR or SG as well as powerful thermal weaponry.
 

The Type II line is GMS’ line of proprietary melee weapons, forged from powerful polymers and  
intended to take maximum advantage of a mech’s extreme strength. The Tactical and Heavy  
Blade line, although called as such, also contain a line of mauls, hammers, picks, and other blunt  
weaponry. The charged blades line, new in GMS weapons development, includes weapons with  
an attached generator that sheathes the blade or head of the weapon in superheated plasma for  
shearing through armor. 
 

The Type III line is intended for specialized or siege warfare. It includes weapons like the widely  
feared GMS Type III AMR, a mech-scale sniper weapon infamous for its extremely high kill  
efficiency, and the Type III “Cyclone” superheavy pulse rifle, a weapon known for its enormous  
rate of fire. The Cyclone is so large that its spare magazines have been reported in some  
incidents to have been used as effective anti-infantry blunt weapons in close combat.

                                             Nuclear Cavalier   

Shortly after becoming a pilot, you realized something: that machine you pilot is powered by a “cold” series  
of cascading nuclear reactions. Why not open up that compartment and see what sort of damage you  

could do with it?   

Aggressive Heat Bleed  (Rank I): When you’re in the danger zone (the bottom half of your heat  
gauge), your first attack roll that hits on your turn deals +2 heat.
 
Fusion Hemorrhage (Rank II): When you’re in the danger zone, your first attack roll that hits on  
your turn deals +1d6 bonus damage.
 
Here, Catch! (Rank III): You can modify your mech to fire its fuel rods as a weapon. Gain a new  
integrated weapon with the following profile (it doesn’t take mount space).

                                                  Gunslinger  

In a galaxy ringed in frontiers, there is no law but the one backed by the gun. You wield the humble pistol  

with a talent unseen in this age, your iron an extension of your own body. As easy as pointing a finger, you  
land your shots with accuracy unmatched by pilot or machine. You are a gunslinger; justice made whole,  
given its sacred instrument, and set out to the wild frontier to tame it.   

Truth and Justice (Rank I): Gain +1 Accuracy on your first two attack rolls in a round with  
auxiliary ranged weapons
 
From The Hip (Rank II): Gain the following reaction:  
         Return fire  
         Reaction  
         Once per round, when you are attacked by a target within your range, you can  
         immediately attack the target with an auxiliary ranged weapon, interrupting their attack.
 
I Kill With My Heart (Rank III): You gain a gunslinger die (a d6), that starts at 6. When you hit  
with an auxiliary ranged weapon, you can reduce this value of this die by 1. When the value of  
this die is 1, you can spend it to make your next auxiliary weapon attack roll deal +2d6 bonus  
damage on a hit. This attack ignores cover. After spending this die, hit or miss, it resets back to  
6.

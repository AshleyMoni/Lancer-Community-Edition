                                                Juggernaut  

A bloody nose or a couple loose screws won’t stop you from hurling yourself headlong into the enemy.  
You’re in a couple-ton hunk of metal, and you’re going to damn well use it.  

Momentum (Rank I): When you take the boost action, the next ram attack you make before the  
start of your next turn knocks your target back 3 spaces further and can be made with +1  
Accuracy
 
Hard-Ultimates (Rank II): If your ram attacks knock a target into another target, both targets  
must pass a hull check or be knocked prone. If your ram attacks knock a target into an obstacle  
or wall, your target takes 1d6 kinetic damage and must pass a hull check or be knocked prone.
 
Unstoppable Force (Rank III): 1/round, when you take the boost action, you can choose to  
supercharge your mech’s servos. Take 1d3+3 heat, but if you move in a straight line your  
maximum speed, gain the following benefits:
 
             -    You can freely pass through enemies the same size or smaller than your mech.  
                 Any actors your mech passes directly through must pass a hull skill check or be  
                  knocked prone
 
             -    You smash through any obstacle or wall the same size or smaller than your mech  
                  in your path, punching a hole through or obliterating it.  
             -    You ignore difficult terrain  
             -    Your movement does not provoke reactions and ignores engagement

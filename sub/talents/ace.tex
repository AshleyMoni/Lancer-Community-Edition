\subsection{Ace}

                                                       Ace  

All pilots brag about their abilities, but some can back it up with proof: to be an ace means you are among  
the most qualified of pilots. Whether you’re a talented rookie or a grizzled veteran, you’ve gained a level of  
notoriety through your flying ability that has your callsign known throughout the system. Most enemy pilots  

flee when they recognize your mech’s distinctive livery, but some see your reputation as a chance to test  
their own mettle.   

Acrobatics  (Rank I): Make all agility checks while flying with +1 accuracy. When any attack  
misses your mech, it can fly 1 space in any direction as a reaction.
 
Afterburners  (Rank I): When you take any boost action while flying, you can elect to move 1d6  
spaces further, but take half of that as heat.
 
Supersonic (Rank III): If your mech ends its turn flying, at the end of your turn, nominate an  
enemy or ally in your movement range and line of sight. At the end of that enemy or ally’s turn,  
even if they are no longer in line of sight or range from you, your mech may fly to any free  
adjacent space to that target as a reaction, as long as there is a path to do so. This movement  
ignores engagement and does not provoke reactions.

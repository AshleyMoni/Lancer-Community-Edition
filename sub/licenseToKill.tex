 LICENSED TO KILL: CHARACTERS IN  
                                             LANCER  

Unlike other role playing games, LANCER does not track currency. Your access to mech gear,  
upgrades, talents, and other aspects of your character are instead gated by licenses. Licenses  
are controlled tightly by the major powers in LANCER and allow holders nearly unlimited access  
to the items they contain.
 

Progression in LANCER is represented through gaining license levels by completing missions,  
which allows you to unlock Ranks in Mech Licenses, unlocking more gear and mechs for your  
pilot to use. All pilots begin at license level 0 and can level to level 12. Higher license level not  
only allows you to unlock mech gear but also allows your pilot’s skills to improve, improves both  
your pilot and mech’s hit points, gives them more talent points to spend on mech combat  
abilities, and allows your pilot to gain extra customization options.
 

Your license level describes both your pilot and your mech - as you level up, your pilot and  
mech will both become stronger and have access to more advanced gear and combat  
techniques. The first section of this book deals with narrative play and playing as a pilot, the  
second with mech combat and playing as a mech, each going into a lot more detail. You can  
return to this section later if you need to refer back to it.
 

                                              Pilot progression  

If you’re new to LANCER, it’s recommended you start a character at Level 0 (you haven’t  
completed any missions). At this level, your pilot has access to only a limited pool of basic  
licenses available to all pilots.
 

At level 0, characters have 4 pilot skills at +2 based on their background, some specialties  
based on their background, +2 to one mech skill or +1 to two mech skills, three rank I talents,  
and have access to all G.M.S. mech licenses. These are basic licenses that give mechs and  
gear that all qualified pilots can access, regardless of license level. For more information on  
mech licenses, building a mech, and a list of gear and mech components, see the section later in  
this book
 

When a character completes a mission, they level up. 
 
             -   They get +2 to any pilot skill and +1 to a mech skill
 
             -   They gain one talent point and one license point to spend on mech talents and  
                 licenses. Spending a talent point acquires a talent or license at rank I. Further  
                 points can then be spent to take a talent or license to rank II or III.
 

                                                                                                                


Grit: A character adds 1/2 their level to attack rolls, pilot Hit Points, mech Hit Points, and mech  
System Points
 
Advance: Every 3 levels (3/6/9/12), a character can get a new pilot specialty, and gets a core  
bonus, a powerful improvement to all mechs they build
 

                                              Retrofitting  

Every time you level up, you can re-allocate all the points from one of your talents to any other  
talent, or you can re-allocate all the points from one of your licenses to any other license. If this  
would cause you to no longer qualify for a CORE bonus, you must replace that bonus with a new  
one that you qualify for.
